Predation
==================

With my basic introduction out of the way 
&mdash; 
where I come from,
what I've seen and endured,
the education and training I undertook,
my *other side* consciousness due to near-death experiences 
&mdash;
we'll get to the core of my story,
the reason I have even decided to speak at all.
We
live in a Satanic-Luciferian system.
Try to detach the terms from their
religious roots.
They have nothing really to do with the Christian
faith.
That's another deception,
a dysphemism.
The religious cover story
is a distraction from the real problem.
Our planet has been overrun with
extraterrestrial agendas,
with human beings as the guinea pigs in
experiments designed to understand god,
because a sentient being is
required 
&mdash;
it can't be done with an animal 
&mdash;
and inter-species commerce
in which human beings are psychically and physically consumed or sold as
sex slaves.
Our consent has been indirectly given by the systems that
have been created to subvert our sovereignty and protection from the
creator.
Extraterrestrials didn't do this to us.
Our own brethren have done it,
the human familiars who were first seduced by unlimited power and indulgence on earth.






I must be clear here.
I'm not a crusader fighting the darkness.
I respect the darkness.
It is our greatest teacher.
You'll understand better in a subsequent chapter when I detail my time in Palo Mayombe.
The darkness must follow the rules,
though.
The universe has a causal
force related to time.
Every thought and action is allocated to the soul
that generated it.
There's a law of harmonics in the universe where a
soul's creation in the dual worlds is returned to it.
You might know
this as karma,
which is a valid spiritual law.
The Abrahamic scriptures
cover it quite well in the reaping and sowing parables.
It's endemic to
every spiritual system in the world.
What we have done is forfeit our
protection under that law by giving our consent through these social
contracts,
all of which were designed for debt accountability.
You have
a social security number so you can pay on the national debt.




Governments literally collateralize the productivity of their
*citizens*.
Citizen is a formal legal designation from Roman law.
It
separates these individuals from the slaves.
A debtor is in a loss of
freedom until the debt is paid.
Governments tell you that citizenship
from birth,
ergo the registering of the birth and the acceptance of a
birth certificate
is the *benefit* of being born in that geography.
Not
really.
It's really the consignment of your productivity as collateral
against borrowing,
and if you look at the balance sheets of most nations
on the earth,
nobody born in a so-called free society is really free.

The debt is so all-consuming now that most people will have to work from
birth to death indentured to the debt and the income tax it
necessitates.
So what does that mean in the context of the 
Satanic-Luciferian systems 
&mdash; 
loss of the right to dissent and presumption of consent to honor the debt.


These left-hand systems have gone through many cultures throughout
history:
Babylon,
Egypt,
even the Mayan blood rituals,
to add a native
dimension to it.
It's an infection that enters the mind,
the same as an individual possession by dark forces.
It always comes through the mind.

These systems have festered and grown out of control in the past,
but
they have never been this entrenched before.
Technology aids them.
The
institutions we created aid them.
The systems aid them.
Satan is the
most recognized left-hand path,
and that's all we're talking about here,
the left-hand path.
It's been around since the beginning of time,
way
before the Christians went to war with the ideological construct they
morphed into Satan.
The Muslims have doubled down on it.
In this world
we are allowed by the laws of free will to explore wholeness through the
dark or the light.
In the occult, these are called the left-hand path,
the path of darkness,
and the right-hand path,
the path of light.
When I
say *Satanic* in this text I mean the left-hand path,
the path of
darkness.
Religion isn't a path.
It's what people choose when they don't
want a path in life,
an afterlife insurance policy sold to the gullible,
a failure to take responsibility,
a failure to seek,
to grow,
to become
the independent being connected to creation we are supposed to be.


The fuel that the Satanic system runs on is children.
The children are
used for sex magic,
torture,
ritual murder,
and too many things to list
here.
The numbers of children,
the global reach of these systems of
practice,
and institutional control they have is staggering.
Most people
struggle with the concept of Satanism.
If they get past that,
they
struggle with the global scope of the practice,
and the final mental
hurdle is the institutional control they have.
I assure you,
it's all
real.


There is a magic in children.
It has to do with the non-separation
between reality and imagination.
This is to my sense what Christ meant
when he said,
*Assuredly,
I say to you,
unless you're converted and
become as little children,
you will by no means enter the kingdom of
heaven.* [^8]

[^8]: Matthew 18: 3, King James Bible

The imagination and reality are one thing from the perspective of the
Satanic practitioner.
Reality is simply their unmanifested imagination.
The rituals are for manifestation,
to bring something into reality.
In a sense,
we are all trying to manifest our reality.
The young student studying all night to become a doctor is trying to manifest that reality
for themselves.
I went through hell to manifest the title of Navy
Special Warfare member,
to be a Navy SEAL.
We've all made sacrifices to
manifest something.
A mother sacrifices her body to produce children.

The difference is we make a personal sacrifice to achieve goals.
They sacrifice others.
It's hard to imagine what could bring a person to human sacrifice.
It's hard to imagine what religious decree could make a person copacetic with taking another human life,
especially a child's.
Yet it goes on.
It goes on at a frequency that would alarm people.
It goes on in circles and among people who might be the last people you would expect to be doing this.
The chief characteristic of the dark rituals is rage.
The practitioners are consumed by a lack of control and to reassert their control or the perception of control they take life.
It's the ultimate commitment to a lost spiritual thread in an individual life.
The dark side can deliver none of the benefits the soul needs to find its true home.


I want you to try to imagine living in a reality that spans multiple spheres or dimensions of expression.
There are too many to count.
Each of those spheres represents our reality.
We, therefore, must ask ourselves what is a reality?
A reality is a chain of constants that allow a being to believe they are living in a reality.
Let's take our planet and our physical reality as the baseline.
Every day the sun rises and sets.
The constellations remain the same at night time.
The elemental structure of air,
earth,
water,
and fire remains constant and build most of the material in this domain.
The force of gravity remains constant and our weight is affixed to the ground.
We don't float away.
Everyone we know who is born will die.
Our parents pass before us.
Our children are born after us.
The generations continue.
Species come and go.
We know the dinosaurs were on the earth because of the fossil record,
but they are no longer here because we don't bump into them when we're hiking in the woods.
Our bodies are susceptible to certain illnesses,
which have been documented by our medical systems.
All of these things form our reality.
They are constant.
They are a small list of the constants that make this physical reality apprehendable to us.
For the most part human consciousness is limited to what the five senses can take in and what the mind can process.
Our senses and our mind appear to have been created to interact with this reality,
therefore we do not feel alien.
We feel as though we belong.
When we look at the other mammal life on the planet we can see that like us they have two eyes,
two nostrils,
a nose,
and two ears.
We know we are different from the rest of nature because we are bipedal.
Nonetheless,
we can see in the other mammalian life-forms a consistency to the life pattern on this planet.
To come into this reality you need a body.
The natural system births new forms of life through women.
It takes a man and a woman to produce a baby.
It's the same for the other mammalian life around us,
cats and dogs, and everything in the wild.
All of these things form the constants that define a reality.



It is the same for all other realities.
When you go and investigate the negative dimensions,
what some might call the hell dimensions,
there are constants that maintain those spheres of reality.
Some regions are kind of like waiting stations.
I hesitate to use the word purgatory because it's so charged with the religions that support it.
These other dimensions have certain constants.
Some are quite dark.
The light that is there is difficult to define.
The only word I can think of is phosphorescent.
It just seems to exist around certain living things,
although even the word living might be misused.
Beings exist in these realms but to say that they live compared to what we call life here in our world might be a bit of a misnomer.
Some of these dimensions exist in context to the earth.
This means that if the earth didn't exist they would not exist.
And in between realms are worlds there can be little buffers as well.
There's a buffer space between the physical world and the lower astral plane.
People who get caught in this place end up living a non-physical existence alongside humanity.
They create a lot of problems for us.
Most if not all of the people that we define medically as schizophrenic are occupied by disembodied beings in this buffer zone.
They operate in groups and there is a social system just like on earth.


When you understand this,
you also understand how misguided the human race is.
It's a strange affectation of our times that as our technology and our sciences appear to grow our comprehension of the spiritual worlds diminishes.
It's hard to imagine living in a world where the medical sciences do not understand what I am describing.
I can assure you that any psychiatrist working in a lockdown facility for twenty years or more would have experiences with schizophrenic people in which they were told things it would be impossible for the schizophrenic person to know unless they were communicating with a disembodied entity.
They brush these concerns and experiences aside and continue with the allopathic treatment for this mental disease,
which is a perpetual paycheck for the pharmaceutical companies and the doctors.
There's no overstating the degree to which the law of economy has screwed us over,
where the law of economy is a spiritual law not often discussed in religions.


The left-hand paths understand the law of economy much better than the right-hand paths.
The right-hand paths that are visible on the planet,
the religions which are constantly seeking new adherents,
are so far lost now that they're more damaging than they are good.
The left-hand path answers questions.
When you meet somebody who has traveled the left-hand path they know what they know and there is no faith involved.
What they are blind to are the spiritual consequences upon themselves to the left-hand path.
This is what their controllers keep from them.
Every religion and spiritual path on this planet is a form of economy,
and all economies are quid pro quo,
and all economies once established do not want to go away.
Just try telling allopathic medicine that they have to give up the pharmaceutical and medical revenue from schizophrenia and see what happens.
Very often everything that happens in these other worlds is visible on this physical plane.
The invisible worlds must represent themselves in this physical reality because there's a law of descent which states that that which exists above must manifest below.


The whole multiverse is a system of contracts.
It's an endless series of exchanges no different than the ecosystem you see in a rainforest or at your local swamp.
This is what has been so perverted in the human mind.
There is this idea of an absolute battle between good and evil.
No such battle exists.
In this regard I place the blame squarely on the mismanagement of the Hebrew text by the Catholic Church and subsequent Islamic caliphates.
To live life without an adversary is to risk not growing at all.
Adversity is your best friend in life.
Never go looking for adversity but where it finds you meet it squarely with your feet planted in the ground.
It's there to make you a new being.
Human transformation is an endless series of conflicts.
It's as though the entire natural world which exists on predation is replicated inside every human being.
Instead of larger creatures in nature looking to consume us,
the beings and entities on the other side who require the energy that human beings produce to survive prey upon us.


In every phase of life we cultivate energy.
How we spend our energy determines the outcome of our life.
It's always best to find something to make offerings to.
It's the only way to expand your consciousness.
You have to enter into a spiritual economy.
When you offer your best energy to the creator you're investing in the creator.
Your best energy is offered up in deep gratitude and complete submission.
The dividends are astounding.
Everything is an economy.
This is the greatest secret you're not told.
It's hinted at.
It's encrypted within complex compound metaphors and allegories.
It's partially decrypted with astrology,
astrotheology,
gematria,
numerology,
and countless other forms of divination both modern and primitive.
But in the end it just is what it is.
When you stop trying to hack it all the time and extort it for some personal benefit to your lower chakras then you enter the larger economy,
then you become a shareholder in the creation,
and the way that corporation is run every shareholder no matter how small is invited to the shareholder meetings.
The meetings are better than the dividend.



There's spiritual energy in human blood.
It exists to a lesser degree in some of the animals around us.
It has to do with this environment and the richness of it.
The adrenochrome is a secondary economy for the human familiars,
the biological dividend that their otherworldly compatriots introduced to them.
It's all just an economy.
Feeding these spirits this energy allows them to do very bad stuff without being consumed by them on the other side.
So it's essentially a proxy killing.
They take the negative energy that we put into the animal or human being and consume it.




You don't need to be Christian,
Jewish,
or Muslim to believe this.
Most of the faithful have no idea what their religious leaders are really doing.
Every religion and spiritual path on the planet has a certain purpose.
This is a highly complicated and multi-layered reality we live within.
Christianity is an offshoot of the Abrahamic root of Judaica.
The Jewish faith has never been about heaven or an afterlife,
not that they deny those things exist,
rather the goal of the religion has been
to bring god into the world.
Islam is the final expression of the Abrahamic lineage,
the last prophet.
There are twenty-eight major
prophets.
By prophetic lineage,
the Jews control the vast majority of the teachings,
twenty-six of the prophets,
yet their population is somewhere around twenty million.
Another three billion people share two prophets 
&mdash; 
with a symbolic tip of the hat to the others 
&mdash;
one and a half
billion for Christianity and one and a half billion for Islam.
Mohamed and Jesus have the numbers in followers but only a small percentage of
the teachings.
It's very strange the way the Abrahamic lineage has evolved,
almost as though god is correcting himself.
I'll get into this
more deeply in a subsequent chapter that deals with my time with Billy
Meier and the Plejeran extraterrestrials.


Satanism is a philosophy and a way of life.
It's so embedded in our
cultures and institutions now that it's indistinguishable from them.
For quite some time there has been,
for lack of a better word,
*magic*
used on the human race which obfuscates this truth.
Magic is a highly complicated thing,
but as real as rain.
Magic is about deception for the non-practitioner.
It's about setting ideas and philosophies inside your mind which become so entrenched that,
despite their counter-intuitive
and counter-spiritual nature,
you accept them.
This is the true practice of magic. 
In many ways, we can see Madison Avenue and the advent of
advertising as a form of mental abuse,
a second cousin to the darker magic that rules us at a governmental and institutional level,
or free-market magic as supposed to institutional magic,
if you will.


Extraterrestrials are a part of this narrative.
We have indeed been heavily influenced by races other than human.
The one among them that gets the most attention is the reptilian race.


The reptilians are mentioned in the Bible.
They are originally part of
the angelic hierarchy. [^9]

[^9]: King James Bible, Psalms 104 Verses 3-5

> Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind: Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire: Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.


This passage in Psalms references the Seraphim,
a dragon or serpent-like being from the Sirius star system.
The fallen angels are therefore in some measure Seraphim,
which is reptilian.
For a deeper understanding of the semiotics and alien codes in our ancient scriptures,
take a look at the work of Pierre Sabak,
either *Holographic Culture* or *The Murder of Reality*,
both excellent reads that give a good picture of the alien influence and presence on our planet.
It's staggering.
You're going to have to do a little bit of work to unlock the puzzle box.
If I went down every rabbit hole I pointed out,
my story would be a thousand pages.



Many of the aspects of Satanism are replicated in commiseration with the reptilian species.
The reptilian species has always been on this planet.
I know this is a difficult concept for people to understand,
but they are technically not extraterrestrial.
They are an indigenous earth race.
There was a time in our past where human beings and reptilians walked the earth together,
among other extraterrestrial races that genetically experimented upon the existing mammalian hominid to create what we call the Adamic race.
They could walk right by you on the street and you would not know that they're extraterrestrial.
There are also human hybrids.


Many of the aspects of modern Satanic ritual do come from the reptilian
culture.
The reptilians are a physically strong race that is presently living underground on the planet,
and they are profoundly psychic up to
the fourth dimension,
or what we called in classical esoterica,
the astral plane.
They can create dreamscapes within a person and abduct people.
In fact,
most of the leading researchers in the exopolitics world believe that the gray abductions are done on behalf of the reptilians.
The reptilians are simultaneously jealous and possessing a profound superiority complex.
If that sounds like a contradiction it's because it is.
But if you examine most spiritual
failings in an individual you'll often find this contradiction at the core,
this unresolved enmity.


Human beings can go to many places.
We are a truly transdimensional species capable of consciousness far beyond the astral plane.
This is the basis of the reptilian fascination with us.
At the same time,
they see themselves superior from a survival position because
creation has made them almost indestructible and possessing a life that
is much longer than human life.
Their forms of worship are very similar to what human beings called Satanism.
They are also,
at least as we understand the reptilian class of being on planet earth that we know about through biology,
cold-blooded.


However,
the reptilians are not the total of what we call Satanism.
Reptilians are capable of possessing human beings from the astral plane.
So we can assume that part of what we call possession is reptilian.
This does not limit the negative cosmology in the things that
can possess a human being.
Dead human beings can possess a living human being.
Older entities not related to any form that we would call an extraterrestrial can possess a human being,
and I believe that the old principalities exist as part of the original cosmology,
Satan,
and the three princes of hell,
Belial,
Mammon,
and Moloch.


Mammon is habitually associated with greed and money.
However,
if you look at the demonic construct of Mammon,
the key takeaway is possession of things,
but money and wealth are just an aspect of it.
The real goal of Mammon is to control the consciousness of the human being so that the energies of man are in service to him.
Belial is the seducer and distractor.
Of all the demons in the cosmology,
Belial is the one that
comes to us more through our senses and our sensuality,
ultimately
inverting these things so that the beautiful and the divine becomes the ugly and the demonic.
Moloch can be looked upon as the enforcer.
In many ways he is the most terrifying of the demons because he takes what is most precious from us, 
our children.
These entities go by many names 
&mdash;
Baal and Baphomet to name two.


The root of Satanism and demonology is absolute contempt for the human race.
Some people who read this text will try to rationalize what is being said here,
suggest perhaps that really what we're dealing with are runaway biological addictions,
like adrenochrome,
sex,
and power,
all components of human weakness,
but it's like I'm telling you.
Don't abstract it,
even though I can understand why you want to do that.
The true purpose of the demonic realm and the Satanic theology is the
subjugation and destruction of the human race,
and this philosophy is so
thoroughly practiced that once it's pointed out you'll be amazed you
never saw it before.
It is my goal to prove these things out as
irrefutable to you.
I am in no way celebrating any one religion as superior to any other religion.
The Satanic problem on this planet affects every human being regardless of religion.
It's an inherited problem,
part of the original creation of this plane of existence that we live within.
Once all of this is properly understood,
there's really nothing to fear.
The problem with the world as we have progressed
through the industrial and technological revolutions,
is that we let our
spiritual defenses down,
and we let the fox into the hen house.


The entire Abrahamic Cannon is a story of extraterrestrials and the
creation of the human race in this third-dimensional reality,
a cosmic history that's produced worshipers and supplicants all through the last six thousand years.
It is, for the most part, a *fourth-dimensional* story.
The way we have habitually integrated with our inner lives is to
characterize these other realities as being *above* us.
What *above* means in the dimensional fence is finer,
subtler,
and,
unless inner apprehension is developed through spiritual practice,
invisible to us while we are physically alive.


The wall between our world and the next world appears to be thinning.
Some would have us believe that this is a natural astrological occurrence.
I think 
it's been manipulated.
If you look at the twentieth century and all of the science that the human race developed,
and you look at the characters within 
the sciences,
many of them are Satanists,
and many of them are operating with the intent of breaching a barrier to our reality.
This is certainly true of 
the *magicians* who have appeared in the last hundred and thirty years,
not least of which were Aleister Crowley and Jack Parsons of Jet Propulsion 
Laboratories (JPL).
There has also been a concerted effort to weaken the human being as a biological instrument.
The chemical trails being sprayed in the 
sky barium and aluminum on the periodic table,
Baal when combined,
the *medicines* being injected into us,
the massive denigration of the nutritional 
content of our modern diet,
and a host of other things which weaken the human aura,
the barrier that protects us from things getting into our 
consciousness.
The same is true for the earth with the non-stop atomic testing,
radiation,
and other means of breaching the ozone layer and fracturing our 
atmospheric protection from what lives in space,
and yes,
there are many things which live in space.
It's a curious thing about human beings that we 
always imagine things that are alive and sentient as being like us.
It doesn't occur to most people that space is a kind of ocean of life invisible to our 
eyes,
and that a planet like earth is like an island within that ocean,
and the last thing we want is the things in the ocean crawling up onto our shores,
but that's what the weakening of our atmosphere does.
It's a one-to-one correlate for the aura around each human body.
The Satanists want to give the keys 
to our realm to their dark allies that we may be breached and overrun by the darkest of forces in the universe.



The world is run by a Satanic superclass that is both supernatural and highly scientific.
Their culture revolves around rituals and those rituals revolve 
around the summoning of demons and the sacrificing of children.
This is the snapshot of our reality in the first quarter of the twenty-first century.
Next comes the proof.
Most of the story has been told at a sociopolitical and economic level already.
*Tragedy & Hope:
A History of the World in Our Time* by 
Carroll Quigley is an excellent overview,
but Quigley never explained why the world is run the way it is.
That's where I come in.
I've seen it all.
Change the words demon,
Satan,
Lucifer,
and anything religious I've said in this chapter to extraterrestrial.
This whole thing is commerce,
nothing more and nothing less.
The blood and energy released in the sacrifices is sought by extraterrestrials.
I shouldn't limit the cosmology I'm defining.
There are spiritual elements to it as well,
where spiritual means human beings in non-physical forms 
&mdash; 
dead 
&mdash; 
and other ghoulish things not extraterrestrial,
but the extraterrestrials sit atop it all,
even administering things like haunting,
possession,
and influencing the minds of most human beings alive today.
It's a shit show,
and I'm sorry to be the one to tell you these unfortunate things,
but there's no more time to dance around the topic.
The stakes are too high,
and we still have a chance of winning this conflict,
those of us willing to face it and deal with it,
but it's not going to be easy.
Why not fight for something meaningful?
