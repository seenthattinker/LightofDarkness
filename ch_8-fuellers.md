Worshipful Fuellers
===========================


This book is about institutional darkness,
institutional Satanism.
As stated in the previous chapter,
darkness and the left hand path have always existed on this planet.
It's part of the free will construct.
My faculties and perception define London, 
England as the inception of institutional Satanism in this cycle of human history,
which we will define as the last two thousand years.




An important thing to understand about British Society is the place of the livery companies.
Livery normally means uniform or official garb of a trade or class.
So we could say that the priestcraft has a livery.
In the British trade system,
liveries were groups of social connection and support for people in various trades,
an early variation of trade unions.
They collected dues and maintained capital to support each other in times of duress and to invest in their industries.
They often have an insignia or coat of arms.
These early livery companies were similar to fraternities,
guilds,
or mysteries that flourished throughout Europe for many centuries. 
The term *mystery* is still in use today,
derived from the Latin *misterium*,
meaning *professional skill*.



The early companies were established as guilds and their roles included regulation of the trades,
quality control,
labor conditions,
and looking after the welfare of their members.
The liveries are a combination of commercial self-interest and benevolence societies with close connection to the church,
hence the *Worshipful* in the titles.


Today,
most of the liveries still encompass these early concepts,
fostering trade,
serving the community,
and embracing modern skills and professions.
Over time,
some companies have failed to survive,
some have spawned new companies and some have combined to ensure their continuance.


Looking at the livery companies today,
many of them are industry specific,
although some have *shifted* their trade support in moving with the times.
The fan makers,
for example,
now support the mechanical fan trade,
including the use of the fan in heating,
ventilation,
and aircraft propulsion.
Some of the liveries are very active in their specific trades:
the gun makers are still responsible for testing gun barrels,
the goldsmiths test precious metals for purity and operate the London Assay Office,
others are only open to those connected with the trade
&mdash;
shipwrights
&mdash;
and some are only open to those qualified in the trade or profession
&mdash;
chartered surveyors.
Some of the smaller companies consist mainly of the original families.
Generations of tradesmen going back centuries.
All of the liveries continue to support education.
Many support individual schools and provide bursaries,
scholarships,
awards,
and prizes.




The Worshipful Company of Fuellers,
often simply referred to as *The Fuellers*,
represents all aspects of the energy industry.
The Fuellers’ origin is the wood mongers of the fourteenth century.
Modern Fuellers encompass coal,
oil,
nuclear,
gas,
electricity,
and renewable energy.
Membership spans production,
supply,
distribution,
marketing,
research,
finance,
education,
and major consumers.


It would be hard to imagine a more powerful livery company than The Worshipful Company of Fuellers.
Most countries would vest their energy needs in the public sector.
In fact,
that's what Britain did up until 1992.
The Department of Energy was formed in 1974 under the Conservative government of Edward Heath.
Heath was an abominable man.
He was a friend of Jimmy Savile,
a fellow recreational child sodomite,
child torturer,
and child murderer,
quite literally a ghoul of a man,
a demon in flesh. 
Heath would have been very well known in London's true Satanic core.
Heath was known to MI5 and MI6. 
They aided and abetted him.


It's curious to note that public energy policy is abandoned in 1992 with the disbandment of The Department of Energy.
Three years earlier Reagan and Thatcher broke the back of communism,
or so it appeared.
It seems to be pretty popular with millennials,
the most digitally mind-controlled generation in the history of humanity,
literally born attached to black screens.
It was like there was a second capitalism waiting,
one with uninhibited predation.
No more Mr. Nice Guy.
Labor got kicked to the curb with free trade deals.
The climate of necessity took over.
If we don't expand our market we'll be unable to compete with the trading block Japan is creating.
It's all phony emergency.
The end of the Cold War commenced the purposeful dismantling of the Western middle class.
Death by carnivorous transnational corporations.
Nobody was thinking long term.
If the consumer base in wealthy and functioning Western economies doesn't exist then who buys the stuff?
How do you maintain price integrity with an ever diminishing consumer demographic?
You don't.
That's the simple answer.
Believing *they* didn't know this is willful ignorance,
dangerous naivety.
The Worshipful Fuellers motto is,
*In Carbone Robur Nostrum*, [^10]

[^10]: Please see Appendix A for Pierre Sabak's deconstruction of the motto and the symbol.

Latin for *Our Strength is in Carbon*.
The molecular structure of carbon is six neutrons,
six electrons,
and six protons.
Human beings are fundamentally carbon.
Most organic life is built off the carbon element.
The number for carbon on the periodic table is six.
The Worshipful Fuellers received Royal Charter from King James I in 1605. 
The Worshipful Fuellers had the distinct position of being tax collectors because the King of England levied dues and taxes on coal.
Right from the beginning they were quasi-public and quasi-private.
A private livery collecting the most prized tax in England.
This placed The Worshipful Fuellers in a knighted position,
and it's the first example of the City of London exercising its powers of taxation all across the Port of London,
a circumference much larger than the City of London.
It could be said The Worshipful Fuellers were the first internal revenue service in Britain.
It was coal with its established tax base that was once again tapped with further excise taxes to rebuild London in 1666.
It's the very definition of irony,
the tax from coal 
&mdash;
incendiary material used in the home
&mdash;
paying for the damages done by a fire that burned the vast majority of London's homes.





You have to understand seventeenth century Britain to understand the beginnings of institutional Satanism.
The Protestant movement had begun with Luther in Germany and found a home in England.
The Bible was the most important document for a monarchy.
It was the foundation of all law.
The king could add law,
but the foundation was the Bible.
It gave every man and woman their god-given rights.
You really have to understand how huge a thing the Protestant and Catholic conflict was.
It upset centuries of status quo in Europe in which the Vatican was the king of kings and gave royal families their status by affirming they were of a bloodline of god.
With the advent of Protestantism,
monarchies had to have their own Bible.
No book no authority.
It was that simple. 
The King James Bible set the stage for the English-speaking world to become the power house it would become.
The translation was done at the behest of King James and the church of England.
It was a dramatic shift back to the Old Testament.
The reincarnation of Yahweh within a breakaway Christian sect
&mdash;
a Talmud for Gentiles.
It was commissioned in 1603 and completed and published in 1611.
As England embraced Protestantism,
those who held onto Catholicism were marginalized.




In 1656 Jews were permitted to openly practice their religion in London,
ending centuries of banishment that had come about from King Edward who had issued an edict expelling all Jews from England in 1290.
The reasons were usury and blood ritual homicide of Christian boys killed around Jewish Passover.
But the New England that was moving away from the Vatican needed all the friends it could find,
and the enemy of your enemy is your friend.
Nobody had been more maltreated by the Vatican than the Jews.
They had also become prominent in European trade through a significant population in Amsterdam.
The English commercial class wanted to capitalize on the trading partnerships of the Jews and expand their own commercial interests.
This was accompanied by Jews being allowed into brokerage and various other forms of institutional and fraternal life in England.
Concessions were made as it pertained to Jews taking the oaths because they were not Christian.
Nonetheless,
in this time of religious feuding between Protestants and Catholics,
the Jews found their place in English commerce and the livery companies.


The Jewish world was rocked in the seventeenth century,
too.
Sabbatai Zevi was declared the *Messiah* in 1666.
This was taken to heart by the diaspora Jews.
It was a kind of heretical and antithetical Judaica,
an apostasy with extreme prejudice.
Followers advocated doing the exact opposite of what the scripture said.
It was a time of tremendous religious upheaval in a Europe where the Vatican no longer ruled.




In 1665 London was hit by the Great Plague.
The plague had been all around the globe for several centuries by this time.
It started in China in 1331.
There were a couple forms of plague.
One was believed to have been carried by the fleas that were on rats and the other was a pneumonic plague.
It's estimated that one hundred thousand people died of the plague in eighteen months in England.
This represented about one-quarter of London's population.
In the winter of 1664 a very bright comet was seen in the sky.
It's part of all the records.
London was something of a catastrophe in the poor sections at this time.
There were open sewers with human waste in the middle of the street.
It was impossible to get any kind of collective hygiene going in the poor areas.
The stench of the poorer areas was overwhelming.
Most people walked around with handkerchiefs over their mouths.
Most of the city's necessities were brought in by cart.
Coal was brought in by river barge.



It's interesting at this point to take a look at the work of William Bramley, 
who wrote the book,
*The gods of Eden*,
which is an examination of an extraterrestrial presence in the history of human affairs. 
Here's what he has to say about the plague.



>Late into dark December nights of the year 1664 London citizens sat up to watch a new blazing star, with *mighty talk* thereupon. King Charles II and his 
Queen gazed out of the windows at Whitehall. About east it rose, reaching no great altitude, and sank below the south-west horizon between two and three 
o'clock. In a week or two it was gone, then letters came from Vienna notifying the like sight of a brilliant comet, and *in the ayr the appearance of a 
Coffin, which causes great anxiety of thought amongst the people.* Erfurt saw with it other terrible apparitions, and listeners detected noises in the 
air, as of fires, and sounds of cannon and musket-shot. The report ran that one night in the February following hundreds of persons had seen flames of 
fire for an hour together, which seemed to be thrown from Whitehall to St. James and then back again to Whitehall, whereafter they disappeared. In March 
there came into the heavens a yet brighter comet visible two hours after midnight, and so continuing till daylight. With such ominous portents the Great 
Plague in London was ushered in. [^11]


[^11]: William Bramley &mdash; *The Gods of Eden*

In his excellent work,
Bramley postulates a custodial race over the human race,
invisible influences behind major world events.
He calls them the custodians.
I agree with Bramley.
The human race has handlers.
I call them the controllers or the chaos makers.
I've seen them with my own eyes.
We'll get into that in future chapters.


If the plague wasn't enough,
the following year London was hit with the great fire.
It began in a bakery on Pudding Street and spread through most of the city,
most of which inside the old Roman city wall was gutted.
Over thirteen thousand houses were destroyed,
eighty-seven churches,
including Saint Paul's Cathedral.
The registered death count is quite low at a meager six,
but it has to be pointed out that the city failed to count the bodies of the poor and many of the people were burned and cremated right in the fire.


London was completely destroyed in those two years.
What the plague didn't kill the fire did,
and the fire killed the plague,
too.
There was a lot of hatred and suspicion.
Some people blamed the Jews,
but the majority of the population turned on the Catholics.
England was beginning to assert itself as a religiously independent nation separate from the Vatican.
There were a lot of English who were still Catholic and loyal to the Vatican.


The following year,
1667,
saw the publication of John Milton's *Paradise Lost*,
perhaps the most epic religious poem from the Christian perspective ever written.
Milton was a Catholic.
His first draft of the poem was dragged into a fire by his dog.
He then went blind.
Without his eyesight,
he reproduced the entire book-length poem by dictating it to his daughters.
The creation of the book is almost as much of a miracle as the book itself.

In the poem we are warned against the enemies of god,
the fallen angels who followed Lucifer into rebellion.
Chief among them are Moloch.
Children are ritually burned for his favor
&mdash;
passing through the fire as it's called.
Belial is the worthless and wicked one.
He counsels immorality and wicked and shameless acts.
Mammon is greed and materialism personified.
Milton is god's marker in the timeline.
This is the beginning of institutional Satanism.
Milton warned us.




What story about seventeenth century England would be complete without mentioning the guild of all guilds that is the centerpiece of every ham-fisted conspiracy theory stammered out on WordPress or YouTube
&mdash;
the Freemasons.
The Freemasons have their origin in the livery companies.
They still exist as The Worshipful Company of Masons,
but here we are strictly speaking about actual masons,
brick,
marble,
and other stone work.
The Freemasons emerged out of the livery company as a purely spiritual guild.
They begin as the speculative masons,
meaning masons who don't work with stone,
and start to form lodges.
It's interesting that this coincides with the return of the Jews under Cromwell.
Both groups share a fascination with spiritual traditions from before Christ,
especially the Egyptians,
who the masons regard as master builders and wizards.
The Jews of course had been scrupulously documenting the spiritual and magical secrets of every group they cohabited with,
including the Egyptians,
Babylonians,
and Sumerians,
with many of the books of the Torah being simple retellings of Mesopotamian parables and spiritual lore.
It is here the sons of Adam find Moloch,
the child eating demon who consumes by fire. 


There is a very distinct Jewish connection to Freemasonry as well in that the Freemasons regard Solomon as the Grand Mason.
Freemasonry is Judaism for gentiles.
Every right,
oath,
and password has its ritual ancestry in the Hebrew religion.
King Solomon's construction of the first temple is the spiritual ideal of the Mason ensconced within the fundamental metaphor of building.
King Solomon is known to have been given a signet ring,
the Star of David,
to control demons.
It is said in the Jewish lore that Solomon used demons to construct the first temple.
The Freemasons are enamored by a Jewish King who controlled demons and built the temple for blood offering and burnt offering to his god.
Nothing creepy about that at all.
So we have the Jews formally let back into England in 1656 and a decade later speculative Freemasonry emerges in London.



It needs to be understood how the Jews arrived back in England.
They underwrote the efforts of Cromwell to unseat King James and his line.
Merchant Jews of Amsterdam had amassed a tremendous wealth and influence in Europe.
Remember,
corruption must be offered and received for the contract to be complete.
It's a two-way street.
The Jews had despised the Romans and all of their outposts from the destruction of the second temple onward.
We are,
after all,
dealing with a people who by oath to their god must settle all debts,
and sin 
&mdash;
defiance of god's law as defined by the Jews,
as there can be no god but theirs
&mdash;
is the greatest debt of all.
Christianity,
even with its Byzantium makeover,
was still the empire that unseated the temple and massacred many Jewish families.

Usury was institutionalized by European Jews to gain control over monarchies.
The Jews have been at war since the second temple was destroyed.
How hard is that to understand?
They were a complete people.
They had land,
water,
culture,
language,
literacy,
law,
mysticism,
and religion.
They were a fully formed human culture.
How many cultures of the time could say that?
Certainly the Greeks.
Rome was the great amalgamation.
It brought everything into one place.
The Caesars were as enamored by the Jewish rabbis as they were by the Greek mathematicians and the Celtic Druids.
Rome was multicultural.
It was one of those times in history when so many things came together that it forced a new perspective.
This multiculturalism would be repeated in Byzantium and later in Barcelona.
It's kind of weird how we're always wanting to hate each other and always wanting to know each other at the same time as human beings.

It cannot be denied that Rome usurped the history of the Jewish prophets by grafting itself onto the story of Christ in the formation of the Vatican.
It was geopolitical.
Not spiritual.
Imagine the determination in keeping that ghosted culture alive for centuries.
The rabbis and the synagogues did all that.
They taught Hebrew even while Jews had to learn another language in whatever country they were living after yet another diaspora.
They were taught literacy in at minimum two languages and basic arithmetic at a time when most of the world's population was illiterate farmers.
The Romans built an empire on the backs of their prophets. 
It's the single greatest act of cultural appropriation ever.
It's pure Machiavellian genius when you think about it. 
The Vatican policed Europe with Jewish law and collected all the taxes and indulgences associated with that wonderful economy.
Nobody really saw a big problem picking a fight with a god who takes blood sacrifices and burnt offerings.
It's kind of amazing the stupidity of it all.

The Amsterdam Jews got their bank in England by becoming Cromwell's creditors.
For his part,
Cromwell consented to the trial and execution of King Charles I.
There was prolonged insurgency that contested the throne between the House of Stuart and the Dutch drop-in,
William the Orange,
the Amsterdam Jews' man in London,
part of the interest on Cromwell's debt.
The Stuart line regained the throne after The Bank of England was formed.
It is the first real central bank,
and serves as the model for all other central banks in the world.
I know,
you thought the Americans were running things.
No,
that's a distraction.
It's all City of London.
It always has been.


Curiously,
The Worshipful Fuellers went away when banking came into Britain.
The banks handled the carbon tax.
They surfaced again in the early eighties.
Same name and logo
&mdash;
*In Carbone Robur Nostrum*, 
Latin for *Our Strength is in Carbon*.
By the time they received their new Royal Charter in 2012,
banks were failing and the carbon tax was coming back.
