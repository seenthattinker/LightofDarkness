Palo Mayombe
===================

My adventures with the crew in Switzerland went on for a number of years.
I studied in grapple with the material.
I knew it to be true but I knew it wasn't the final solution to what was going on on this planet.
I had many experiences with radians.
Once you hook up with them,
especially the ones Around Billy Meier,
who,
I must say at this point,
I do not believe are real blade ends,
but rather an imposter group,
they pop up from time to time.
There were times I would be driving down the highway on the California coast and I would look in my rearview mirror and there would be a spaceship trailing me.
By this time,
which was around 2011,
my inner abilities to see things with my mind's eye and my sense of understanding about the Unseen things was getting a Sharp As a Razor.
The trip to Switzerland in the studying of the pleiadian material only whet my appetite for more understanding of the  non-material World switch were full of life.


I was also going through a very difficult divorce at this time with my son's mother,
who had come back into our lives and was creating a lot of disturbance for myself and my son Reis.
If you had returned a number of years later after abandoning recent I.
My access to my son was through her.
And I was being squeezed for more and more money.
I was always in court.
It was one of the worst periods of my life.
I had already gone back to University in those years as well and studied law.
I never took the bar exam but I did take a little legal courses and I did pass.
It's a weird thing about me.
I study things but I don't necessarily get the accreditation.
It's as though some part of me knows that accreditation is a bunch of bullshit.
I was representing myself for the most part in the proceedings in court.


At that time I had extended my boat washing business into deck reconstruction as well.
Anything that involve diving I loved.
So building decks that one far out into the water for larger boats with something that I got into.
There's always a way to make a living if you have a little bit of creativity and a work ethic.
Don't let anybody tell you any different.
I had hired Latino guy to help me.
He was good with wood,
a really efficient Carpenter.
I don't know what he saw in me,
but one day he said,
hey man,
I think somebody's fucking with you.
I replied sarcastically,
what gives you that impression?
The fact that I'm in court twice a week?
No,
He said.
I mean in a different way.
I mean I think somebody's working Magic on you.
You should come and see my godfather.
I had no idea what he meant by Godfather.
He explained that he sometimes used the services of a Tata in the Palo Mayombe religion.
I'd never heard of it.
I knew about Santeria and voodoo but I never heard of  Palo Mayombe.
We talked about it a little bit while we were working on the deck,
and I agreed to take a drive out to a certain part of Los Angeles and meet with his Godfather.
I had nothing to lose,
and I was more than a little bit curious.


My buddy and co-worker did such a good job of telling me about this stuff that I decided hey I'm going to go see this Godfather tonight.
So when we were done work which was this late at night,
sometime around 9:
30p.
m.
,
well I got in my truck and drove to Compton,
a place called The Magical cave.
My friend,
Luis,
went in alone to see if it was okay to bring me in.
All I could see was Darkness.
There was plate glass in front of the place and it was tinted so dark that you couldn't see Within.
It looked like a television screen turned off.
The door pulled open again and Louise stuck his head out and said hey come on Inn.
I told Reese to stay in the truck.
I went to the door and poked my head in to get a feel of the place.
It was dark with some candles lit.
I went back to the truck and I told Reese look I'm going to lock the doors you just stay in here and have a nap okay.
We did that and I went inside.



I went through the door and met Lewis and he said hey just sit down here and when the Godfather comes out  don't say anything just hand him the picture of your ex-wife.
I did what I was told.
So The Godfather,
a Latino man and his mid-to-late forties,
came out and introduced himself.
He looked at me and he said,
are you in law enforcement?
I gave him my brief background and told him I was a Navy SEAL and he said that he could see it all over me.
I handed him the picture of my ex-wife and he said,
without knowing it was my ex-wife,
she wants you dead.
She wants all of the assets.
She hired someone to do magic on you.
Do you know a woman with dark curly black hair?



The next thing The Godfather did was disappear into another room.
I later learned that this was the Manassa.
The Manassa is where the McDonald's are held.
The spirits in the pots.
But I'm getting ahead of myself.
We'll get to that in a moment.
I think he had to ask for permission to bring me in.
When he came back out he asked me to follow him into the Manassa.
I did as I was instructed.
I told Louise to keep an eye on the outside to make sure Reese was okay in the truck.
I was told to keep my head bent down in my eyes closed.
I was taken into the Manassa like a child held by the arm.
When we got inside he told me to get down on my knees.
For a moment I thought I was going to be beheaded.
I was cracking my eyes open a little bit here and there and I could see these pots and candles and what I thought was red wax from a candle but later Learned was blood.
I had never been in a room in which blood sacrifices were made before.
There was a palpable energy and presence in the room.
I was told to just breathe and relax.
I slipped into a meditative State and immediately went to another dimension.
I could see with my inner Vision a spirit above each of the pots.
The spirits were egg-shaped.
They were not human Spirits.
They were Elemental spirits.
Each one was a different color.
One was red,
one was green,
one was purple,
and so forth.
I knew immediately that these Spirits could see right through me.
It was impossible to lie.
There was a question that issued forward from the spirits:
what are you here for?
I said nothing.
I thought nothing.
I just stared at them through my mind's eye and they stared back at me.
There was no negativity there.
The space or realm of these Elemental Spirits was neutral.
It was very dark.
A dim light came off of each of the spirits in the color it represented.
But there was no sense of negativity.
There was no overwhelming sense of positivity.
It was like a neutral zone.
There was a very strange peace in the place.



I interpreted the peace as love.
I felt like a newborn baby swaddled in a wool blanket.
It was a beautiful experience.
I did not know that Darkness had such beauty.
It had its own light.
There was a light to the darkness.
I immediately fell in love with it and all of the spirits ran through me as a wind.
A beautiful Cool Breeze.
The Godfather stood me up.
My eyes are still closed.
He walked me into the other room.
The Godfather told me he had never done that before,
never taken someone who had just walked into his shop into the Manassa before.
He told me it never happens.
Only initiates can go in the Manassa.
I don't know what he saw on me when I walk through his door that made him think I was the first person ever that he could take into the Manassa absent an initiation  in Palo Mayombe.
I asked the Godfather how many spirits were in the room.
I told him I saw 12 or 13.
He almost fell off his chair.
He was absolutely and utterly stunned.
Keep in mind,
at this point in my life I really hadn't had any measuring stick for my perception.
I had been seeing things around me since I was a kid and I had my first near-death experience.
But I had no experience with any formal initiated path that commiserated with the other side.
Normally these skills are acquired through practice and initiation.
Apparently I always had them and didn't even know it.



The Godfather knew in that moment that I would be a member of his house.
He fast-tracked me.
I was initiated immediately.
I didn't know it at the time,
but there was a lot of work to be done in these houses.
All kinds of people came to these Godfathers and their associate,
of which I was one,
for advice and counsel and very often for Retribution.
I was immediately given an in nganga,
then another,
then another,
and then I was given my own steel pot.
The steel pot contain the spirit of a Mason who had died.
His ashes were in the pot.
Almost any Spirit could be trapped in a pot or conjured through a pot.
What went into the pots that summoned the nature Spirits would be different than what it went into a pot that summoned a dead human being like the Mason.
My godfather told me that I was assigned the Mason because he did not like women when he was alive and my problems centered around women.

So I got initiated right there and then.
After that I went home.
Reese was staying with me that night so I put him to bed and then a little while later I went to bed.
2 days later when I was alone in my apartment,
taking a shower,
zarabanda came into my home and I had a conversation with him when I was in the shower.
I know this sounds strange,
but this really happens once you've been initiated on these pants.
The spirits begin to communicate with you in a very direct way,
or at least they did with me.
The Experience takes place entirely within your Consciousness,
but your Consciousness begins to take on characteristics of physical reality.
That's how present the spirits are when you're talking to them.
The conversation is completely Lucid.
The responses from the spirit are completely on manufactured by your unconscious.
You are really talking to an individual being in non physical form.
I drove over to my godfather shop that day and told him what happened with the spirit while I was in the shower.
Again,
He was stunned.
Clearly I was an exceptional acolyte in the science and magic of Palo Mayombe and communication with the spirit world.
My godfather had big plans for me.



The initiation process is very physical.
Your blood actually goes into the pot and mixes with the dirt in the pot.
And then you take some of the dirt out of the pot and rub it into the wound.
The cut is made right where the thumb in the forefinger have their joint.
One small cut on the top and one small cut on the inside and then the blood is squeezed into the pot.
This joins you with the spirit in the pot.
There were some rules that went with the initiation as well.
We were committed to following the laws of God.
We were committed to never going against our Godfather.
The secrets of Palo Mayombe can never be revealed to non initiate's.
I was instructed to always work with the spirits in a respectful way.
All of these things were put forward as postulates and the initiate had to agree and a firm that they would follow the rules.
The entire experience was very loving.
It had the same piece as being in the spirit Dimension the first time I went into the Manassa.


It's difficult to explain,
but I'll try.
The dark side,
which we can put entirely Under the Umbrella of the satanic luciferian path,
has the ability to manufacture something that feels like love.
All of these entities exist within dark matter.
And follow my own B we call this PO.
In Palo Mayombe we refer to the po  as a feminine space.
It's also in neutral space.
This means it's not charged positively or negatively at an emotional level.
It's almost like you're sitting in the den Center of all emotional experience and it's perfectly balanced out and the sum of all emotions is encapsulated in that dark matter,
that dark space,
the Po.
It's one of the great secrets of the left hand path,
the darkness is perfect peace.
You are at peace.
Things can be called from the dark matter to manifestation through Divine love.
The Divine love attracts the matter and it's formed into whatever is requested.
And that's how the darkness works.
When you're in the dark space,
everything backs off and just leaves you be.
And the sense of tranquility and peace is absolutely mind-numbing.
It's one of the most beautiful things I've ever experienced.


There is no Beauty like it on Earth.
It's as though you're standing in front of God.
But it is the dark God.
It is the god of the darkness.
There are in fact two gods,
one of the light and one of the dark.
The dark is the feminine the light is the masculine.
The dark God is the feminine in the light guard is the masculine.
This is how the Dual worlds work.
Within the world of the Dark Matter there are practitioners who try to hide in there and do very negative things.
They sort of try to create their own worlds in there and hide in the cracks at the darkness.
This is how the really dark magic is done.
It's a violation of the rules of both the light and the dark.
It's an abomination.
When trying to understand the light in the dark and why the Creator would make both sides and create a god at the top of each side,
try to see it this way.
If we look at the insect World human beings are uniformly revolted by a cockroach.
And generally speaking human beings are generally delighted with a butterfly.
Both are created by the time Prime Creator to balance out the energies in the Dual worlds in to serve certain functions.
It's true that the butterfly has no real natural function except for a little bit of pollination,
but their workload is about 1% of what the bees do.
The Cockroach on the other hand is a tireless worker for the natural system cleaning up messes left by deaf and other things that need to be cleaned up in nature.
They go when they eat things and they clean up things that would otherwise stay around and maybe cause disease or create problems for the natural system.
They're one of the hardest-working things in the natural system.
But to a human being a cockroach should be stepped on in a butterfly should be celebrated.
Palo Mayombe taught me to see the beauty in everything.


With my initiation completed I began my apprenticeship under my godfather.
I was assigned an in Ghana,
but I won't get into that because it's too dangerous for public knowledge.
I wouldn't want to be responsible for anybody trying any of this stuff at home and bringing extreme Misfortune into their lives.
The first thing my godfather taught me was how to read pictures.
How to look at a picture of someone given by a client and read what was going on in the picture and get a psychic imprint of the person in the picture.
I was taught how to remote view.
I was taught how to talk with the spirits.
Most of the stuff my godfather was teaching me I already knew how to do but I had to go through the motions just like you have to go to Bud's school to become a Navy SEAL.
I was taught how to work with the spirits and how to get things done.
I was taught how to do magic.
I was taught how to mix natural things together to produce an effect.
This is the magic of the elements,
the basis of so many magical systems in the world.
I was taught how to clean people.
I was taught how to do animal sacrifice correctly,
and what the blood symbolized and what the blood meant on the other side.
I got to see it with my own eyes.
I was taught how to exercise people and how to help them with ailments and how to help them with relationship problems.


As my apprenticeship progressed I began to get my own clients assigned to me by my godfather.
At this point it kind of worked like Amway.
I would keep a little bit of the commission for the spiritual work but the bulk of it would go to my godfather.
As my involvement in Palo Mayombe continued I began to notice something very interesting.
Our magic did not work on people who called on the name of Jesus Christ.
I found this very curious.
Impala we have Tim Blake Tara which is basically Jesus Christ.
This is one of the patrons assigned to me through my initiation,
one of the patrons that I related to very well.
Tiembla Tierra represents the height of knowledge and love.
My other Patron was Madre de agua,
which represents the depths of things.
My godfather told me that my ability to work with these two patrons which represented the polarity,
the two opposite extremes of Palo Mayombe,
was very rare.
Throughout all of this I saw other people coming and going for initiation an apprenticeship and I can tell you that I was not being flattered for any reason.
My godfather was telling me the truth.
My apprenticeship like my initiation was a series of stunning Revelations for my godfather as he begin to chart my potential within the path.



I could work with all of the spirits.
There was no limitation on me.
My godfather used me a lot.
I was assigned to a lot of the clients.
Overtime I began to notice that my godfather had a fear that I would grow stronger than him  on the path.
I figured out after some time that Not only was my blood in the pots but so was my Godfather's.
This was a violation of the rules.
Each initiate was supposed to be given their own Spirit pots and be unmolested a nun interfered by any other practitioner of Palo Mayombe.
The individual relation with the spirits was sacrosanct to Palo Mayombe.
My godfather was watching me through my own pots.
This meant that I was a slave to my godfather.
He owned me through the pots.
His dirt was mixed with my dirt.
His blood was mixed with my blood.
He controlled me through my own spirits.
He didn't tell me this up front.
It was a great deception in the violation of the rules of Palo Mayombe,
but,
it really wasn't that surprising when I figured it out.
The key thing to know here is that he was in the wrong from the perspective of the rules of Palo Mayombe and from the perspective of the spirits themselves.
This sliver of guilt in the heart of my godfather commenced with his duplicity at the Inception of my sojourn through Palo Mayombe ultimately became his undoing.

Alongside this growing awareness of my godfather is duplicity in his  introducing me to Palo Mayombe,
was my growing curiosity be about why none of our magic would work on somebody who called on Jesus Christ.
I consulted the pots and I was told that the spirits and tell him I only had a contract with the spirits associated with Jesus Christ in the modern incarnation of Christianity.
essentially,
What the pots told me was that when a person went to Jesus Christ they were already done in and so the spirits of Palo Mayombe didn't have to do anything.
Now think about that very hard.
I'm not trying to offend anyone who has been raised in a faith in a belief in Jesus Christ.
I'm sharing direct intelligence from the spiritual World about what Jesus Christ and the teachings and the spiritual milieu on the other side has come to represent.
People who go to Jesus Christ and into the church system get done in the same way that we get done in if they were dealt with by the spirits in Palo Mayombe.
Think of it this way.
It was like getting a contract to pave a driveway and when you get to the house the driveway is already paved so there's no work to be done.
I realize what I am saying might be profoundly offensive to a lot of Christians.
I'll give you one example in the Contemporary news.
John of God in Brazil was reputed to be a Christian healer.
I knew way before the news came out about him running a child trafficking ring and throwing teenage girls into enslavement to produce babies to sell on the open market that he was a practitioner of the dark side.
I knew the grouping of spirits he was working with on the Christian side and they are extremely malignant.
It later came out in the news that John of God was basically a demon in flesh.
Any practitioner of Palo Mayombe or Santeria or any of the other fourth-dimensional spiritual Arts could have told you this way before the newspapers did.
