September Eleventh
=======================


After the bar interview with the CIA recruiter in the Philippines,
I was a known being.
What do I mean by that?
Once they see you,
they know you.
Once they know you,
they don't go away.
They are the controllers.
This is a controlled reality.
There is nothing random.
As much as it may seem random,
it'sn't.
My world started to collapse.
Everything I thought I knew about this reality fell away.
I started to see the controllers.
Not all the time,
but with sufficient frequency to remind me they were there.
I don't know where they come from or what they really are.
I know they run the show here on earth.
It set me on a quest for knowledge that would eventually take me to Switzerland to meet with the Plejeran group headed by Billy Meier.
That's a pretty far cry from Mormonism.

What was it about 911 that shook everybody?
To my sensibilities it was too blatant.
It was impossible to look upon that spectacle and not see lies.
The first and most obvious layer was the ritual aspect of it,
however,
not a lot of people could decipher it back then,
including me,
but I didn't need to understand it ritually back then.
That's not who I was in 2001.
I was still a soldier in my mentality.
I was logical in my thinking,
and still largely one dimensional,
despite the growing awareness of this other side around me that had been articulating itself since I was a child,
and which fully revealed itself in the Philippines.
My spirit woke up inside of me in that hotel bar.


The first thing that has to be noted is that the buildings were demolished.
Remember,
the precursor to the Navy SEALs was the Underwater Demolition Team (UDT).
I'm an expert in demolitions and explosions.
Those were controlled demolitions.
At the base of the two towers were small nuclear devices.
That's why the site is called *ground zero*,
which is a term reserved in the military for the sites of nuclear events.
Above the base,
charges were set all through the various floors of the building.
Building Seven was left standing after the alleged collision by the planes but collapsed afterwards,
again in a controlled demolition with professionally placed explosives. 
The BBC actually reported it fallen before it collapsed,
an embarrassing lapse in coordination between the CIA and MI6.



There isn't a structural engineer or architect in the world that would vouch for the official story,
unless they were well paid or compromised.
Remember,
compromise as I described it in the Richard Kane chapter is a large part of how they run this system.
Compromise locks people into their obligations to the control system.
When you think about it,
power really can't operate any other way.
People aren't there for the greater good.
The professions knew to stay quiet,
for their own good.



They aren't there for service,
but that's what we're led to believe.
It's a grand inversion.
That's what the left hand path does.
It inverts everything.
The education system doesn't grow your children.
It retards their growth.
The healthcare system doesn't keep you healthy.
It impedes your health.
The law doesn't protect you or create righteousness in your society.
It perpetrates abuses and corrupts your societies.
It treats the golems,
the corporations,
as persons and reduces the living men and women to persons on equal footing with the golems.
Our religious leaders don't guide and protect us.
They malign and abuse us,
and in many cases ritually kill the most innocent among us.



So why wasn't a single structural engineer or architect interviewed on the news to explain the oddity of the government's story?
The official story tells us that the heat from the plane fuel melted the support beams on the building.
It's preposterous.
There was a report prepared by a German engineering firm that refuted the official story,
but that's the only thing I saw.
I spoke to an architect friend,
and he told me his office had a visit from the FBI and the architects were told their licenses would be revoked if they spoke publicly against the official story of 911.
I suspect a number of professions had similar visits from our very corrupt FBI.


One of the prepackaged elements of the government narrative was the moving and distressed cell phone calls from the flight that was allegedly taken down by passengers,
the flight which allegedly went down in Pennsylvania.
I worked at McDonnell Douglas the aerospace company,
and I learned a lot about commercial airplanes. 
The plane alleged to be over Pennsylvania would have been above ten thousand feet in the air.
There was no technology at the time to make cell phone calls from a plane over ten thousand feet.
They needed the calls for the emotional detail in their narrative.
There was also the curious lack of debris in both Pennsylvania and Washington DC
&mdash;
where the Pentagon was struck
&mdash;
and what is most curious about that is the suggestion the engines disintegrated on impact.
Airplane engines are nearly indestructible.
The engines are so densely built they're found at every crash site.
I won't bore you with all the details,
just trust me,
airplane engines don't disintegrate.
Why haven't any telecommunications engineers or aerospace engineers spoken out?
They got the cell phone tech out about six months after 911.
They rushed it,
put a concerted effort into it,
because they realized it was a big gaff. 
Now anyone looking back almost twenty years would have a hard time figuring out the cell phone tech was not available because it's release date was so soon after 911.


The next thing that must be noted is there was no investigation.
The culprit was announced early.
It was nineteen Saudi terrorists with box cutters,
led and financed by a shadowy figure named Osama Bin Laden,
a guerrilla fighter who lived in caves and used a dialysis machine for his kidneys.
There was,
therefore,
no reason to conduct a proper investigation.
All of the evidence,
which would have had radiation signatures,
or chemical signatures,
as certain explosives can be traced right back to the lab that produced them,
was packed up and sent to a landfill in China,
yes,
China,
our evidence locker for the greatest crime ever perpetrated on our soil. 
Why haven't any police,
FBI,
or insurance underwriters spoken out?
Why isn't the public outraged no investigation was conducted or that China was given the evidence?



People go on and on about what some shadowy *deep state* did to us on 911,
but nobody steps up,
certainly no trade unions,
no engineering societies,
no architectural societies,
no military people,
no demolition people
&mdash;
nobody.
The attack on 911 wasn't a conspiracy.
It was an open secret.
We stood back and watched.
We failed the human Boolean decision:
yes, 
allow them to do this to us,
or no,
stand up and tell the truth. 
Shortly after the incident,
in which no international voices spoke out about the lie,
we were mobilizing for war under Bush,
Cheney,
and Rumsfeld.
We all sat back and didn't do a thing.
The question put to us,
in our unexamined emotional frenzy,
was blood or no blood?
Do you want to go to foreign lands and rape,
pillage,
plunder,
and murder?
And we all said yes.
Because we didn't have the courage to face the real enemy,
our own Satanic government.
That does not bode well for us.
This law of cause and effect is unfailing.
We were scapegoated into accepting the karmic liability of their actions.
And that's how the whole system works.
That's how the Babylonian money magic works.
It compromises us by tacitly controlling us.
Nobody wants to say it out loud.
It's too uncomfortable.
We allowed millions of people to be murdered for salaries,
medical and dental benefits,
little league fees for our children,
vacations,
and pensions.
It's that simple.
That's how little it took to compromise us.
What does it matter if a communist politburo runs you if you live in a country that allows you to speak your mind then so thoroughly destroys your life and ability to support your family that nobody speaks their mind?
In the end,
what's the difference between a monetary system that crucifies whistle blowers and a system that kills dissenters?
Not much at all,
but we continue the pretense we're a free society.
The Obama administration made it a point of pride to severely punish whistle blowers.



Our leaders dipped our hands in blood.
It has been their goal and mission,
given to them by the controllers who run the world,
to destroy America,
but America was so strong it couldn't be destroyed.
The American spirit was so vital,
so entrenched in the national collective,
that no direct assault upon it could win,
and so indirect assault was chosen,
a series of lies and a series of simple yes or no moral decisions.
When we failed those tests we commenced our national suicide.
Nobody had to kill us.
We were convinced to do it ourselves.
This is how magic works.


We love to participate in the public moral outrage against monsters.
Sure,
ask anybody,
Charles Manson,
Ted Bundy,
and Jimmy Savile were monsters.
My god,
the moral outrage says,
what could produce a person like that?
But what about the jail guards at Abu Ghraib in Iraq?
Normal American men and women who suddenly found their psychotic sides with only the slightest of provocations. 
How do we explain that?
Here's a section from Major General Antonio M. Taguba's report on the prison,
a report which was never meant to go public,
but was quoted in the *New Yorker* in an article titled,
*Torture at Abu Ghraib:
American soldiers brutalized Iraqis. How far up does the responsibility go?*
It was written by Seymour M. Hersh.[^18]

[^18]: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/05/10/torture-at-abu-ghraib

>Breaking chemical lights and pouring the phosphoric liquid on detainees; pouring cold water on naked detainees; beating detainees with a broom handle and a chair; threatening male detainees with rape; allowing a military police guard to stitch the wound of a detainee who was injured after being slammed against the wall in his cell; sodomizing a detainee with a chemical light and perhaps a broom stick, and using military working dogs to frighten and intimidate detainees with threats of attack, and in one instance actually biting a detainee.


The human race is on a tightrope balanced between dignity and growth and a depravity that descends below the baseline dignity of nature,
where predation is only for survival.
Is it wired into us?
Is it environmental?
It's neither.
It's more akin to possession.
The pot of spirits that would have already existed at Abu Ghraib after years of torture and murder by Saddam Hussein and his regime was ready and willing to take over the weak minds of American service people.
It's the answer nobody wants to hear.
Everybody wants to live in a packaged world.
You start talking about the spiritual reality that human beings live within and people lose their minds.
It's more egregious than the original moral offense.
Bundy,
Manson,
Savile,
and a host of people too numerous to list here were *sick*.
It's a comfort word
&mdash;
*sick*.
All of the mystery is packaged in that one amorphous term
&mdash;
sick
&mdash;
and the security blanket of authority is put over our cold shoulders and we're metaphorically given a hot cup of coffee. 
It's all going to be okay.
They're just *sick*.
Anything to avoid the good and evil debate.
Anything to make the conversation something other than spiritual. 



American society split in 2001.
Nobody saw it right away.
It was like stage one cancer,
but the split was there.
It was a fascinating time because it was also the beginning of the computer age,
the networking age.
Something that needs to be understood is the world of computers and networking back in 2001.
It wasn't as heavily policed as it is today.
You could still find chat rooms that were privately run off of private servers that were very well secured against penetration.
The most open and honest conversations went on across the world between interested parties.
This is before YouTube came out and before video streaming online and all of the things that we call network communication now.
It was really the wild west.
It didn't last long,
but almost everything in the world got hacked between 2001 and 2003.
It was a golden age for freedom of information without filling out the nonsensical paperwork for the police division or the intelligence division or the government bureaucracy from whom you wanted to get information.
Most of the time they wouldn't even give you what you were looking for.
Because they retain all the records,
and the records aren't public,
and if you don't ask specifically for what you're looking for they won't give it to you,
the whole Freedom of Information Act that permeated the Western democracies is complete nonsense.
It's just another lie.
People found their own way to get information.
I direct you to Gary McKinnon. [^19]

[^19]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_McKinnon

>Gary McKinnon (born 10 February 1966) is a Scottish systems administrator and hacker who was accused in 2002 of perpetrating the "biggest military computer hack of all time," although McKinnon himself states that he was merely looking for evidence of free energy suppression and a cover-up of UFO activity and other technologies potentially useful to the public. On 16 October 2012, after a series of legal proceedings in Britain, Home Secretary Theresa May blocked extradition to the United States.

Gary did that with an eleven kilobyte dial-up modem.
Gary found files on extraterrestrial contact.
NASA and the American intelligence community went ballistic.
They waged war with the UK to have Gary extradited for espionage.
Gary has mild autism.
To their credit,
the UK would not allow Gary to be extradited.


I started to form a picture of the world.
Everything that happened in the world was planned and orchestrated.
And this included the taking down of the two towers in New York City.
What the alternative media and the so-called conspiracy world has failed to grasp even twenty years later is that no accident was made on 911.
It was the beginning of this invisible governing force in the world declaring themselves.
Did you ever think it would come any other way but sideways?
Do you really think somebody's going to stand up in front of the podium and say that they're at the head of a Satanic underworld that controls everything?
They wanted us to know they took down those towers and they sent a missile into the Pentagon.
They wanted us to know.
Imagine a psychopath with a genius intelligence quotient going into an interrogation room with two homicide detectives.
Through an elaborate dispensation of information he allows the homicide detectives to unequivocally know that he is the person who committed the murder while
at the same time 
letting them know they will never be able to prove it and continuing to harass and pursue him will be a complete waste of the resources of the police department.
That's what 911 was.
It was the beginning of a dialogue with the demonic underworld that controls us.

The biggest mistake that everybody makes who tries to figure out what is going on in this world is too intellectually compete with them.
We can't intellectually compete with them.
They have all the data.
The danger in conspiracy theories is that if you come too close to what really happened,
and you begin to publicize it on a blog or a YouTube channel,
what will invariably happen is they will go through back channels to release a little bit of the evidence related to 911 that disproves a small portion of what you said.
The evidence will be overwhelming and all reasonable people will accept it,
because it's evidence,
and they are the only ones with the evidence,
and by cracking even a small part of your story they crack the whole story.
People are preconditioned to believe authority.
It negates confrontation.
Most people are afraid of confrontation.
This is how the powers-that-be win time and time again.
There are too many stupid people who stand up and try to tell us what they think happened.
Nobody can say what happened on 911.
If there was radioactive material on the rubble why don't we know about it?
If there was a chemical signature that could be attributed to a certain type of high-end non-nuclear explosive that could be traced back to a specific laboratory of production,
why don't we know about it?
We don't know about it because no investigation was done.
That's all you need to know about 911.
There is no conspiracy theory.
They are indirectly telling you the truth:
*We demolished these two towers and Building Seven. What the hell are you going to do about it?*
The answer of course is nothing.
We didn't do a thing about it then,
and we've done noting about it since,
and they've grown bolder and bolder.
Bullies don't stop unless they're stopped.



The complicity of the mainstream media cannot be dismissed.
What happened to investigative reporting?
Except for a few intrepid freelancers who can barely make a living,
there is no more reporting in the world.
It's all public relations now.
All opinion on large events is basically trickle-down information from the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States,
who themselves are controlled by the Committee of Three Hundred.
All of the media in the United States has been concentrated in a few hands,
and they're working for people who choose to remain anonymous.
There is no conspiracy theory.
You are led by demonic forces.
You are being led by ritual Satanists and Luciferians.
It isn't a conspiracy.
They're pretty much telling you all the time.
You're just not paying attention.


Conspiracy theory is just a public pretense that we still have freedom.
It's as much of a cognitive dissonance as the people who pretend nothing happened out of the ordinary on 911.
Both polarities:
the people who put their head in the sand,
and the people who try to dig into the details to come up with a conspiracy theory of what happened on 911,
are both suffering from the same cognitive dissonance,
the same inability to address the truth that has manifest right in front of your eyes.
You have no freedom.
You can be killed at any time.
You are dispensable human collateral in a larger agenda.
The world is run by ritual Satanists and Luciferians.
We had a simple binary decision,
a simple Boolean decision to make in the weeks and months after 911,
tolerate this abuse or stand up to it.
We folded.
We chose our comfortable daydream in the first world,
and,
as the poet William Butler Yeats put it in *The Second Coming*.

>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;\
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,\
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere\
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;\
The best lack all conviction, while the worst\
Are full of passionate intensity.
