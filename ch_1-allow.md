Allow Me to Introduce Myself
=====================================

My name is Robert Wiegand.
I have a story to tell.
It's not like any story you've heard.
I promise you.
My story will clear a lot of things up for you.
We live in crazy times.
There's a deluge of information but a drought on context.
Nobody can properly contextualize the phenomenon and the information.
Are extraterrestrials real?
Why are so many former military people talking about them?
Is the biosphere really close to collapsing?
Do elite groups of people around the planet really partake of Satanic rituals?
Is pedophilia an epidemic? 


Without the ability to contextualize what's going on we become more imbalanced.
Nothing in nature can exist without a context.
The colors on a rainforest frog in Nicaragua make no sense in a Canadian forest.
The life process gave the frog the colors for the rainforest context.
The same is true for human beings.
We need to understand our environment,
the space in which we live,
what placed us here and why.
Human beings have two environments,
an outer and an inner,
with no context for either.
Neither our science nor our religion serve us anymore.
We've built so quickly and so completely that we've lost control of the world we built.
The world that was created for us,
the natural wold,
would have gone on almost indefinitely.
It was a perfect system,
created by an intelligence far greater than human.
It was a garden of perfection until our fear infected it. 
At some point in our evolution nature became the enemy.
Our thinking changed.
We allowed our fear to convince us that everything in nature was trying to kill us,
that we didn't belong here.
Creation makes no mistakes.
This great blue spaceship is exactly where we belong. 





The world isn't maintained by us,
which is a small blessing.
The world's decline grows in direct measure to our belief that we have to maintain it.
What part of the world requires our maintenance?
Do you honestly believe the world would slip into dysfunction if human beings disappeared?
There would be greater consequence if ants disappeared,
bees,
or spiders.
They serve an indispensable role in the ecosystem.
Not so much human beings.
The world existed long before us and it will exist long after us.


The world is not trying to kill us.
Our belief that it's trying to kill us underwrites the world's decay.
Nowhere is this better explained than in one of the central characters of Cormac McCarthy's literary masterpiece,
*Blood Meridian or The Evening Redness in the West*,
published in 1985.
In this extraordinary piece of American and world literature,
Judge Holden,
the defacto leader of the Glanton gang,
which survives by hunting Apache scalps along the Texas-Mexico border on commission from local mayors and governors,
has the following exchange with one of the gang members beside a campfire when the Judge is asked why he shoots and stuffs all manner of creature in their travels and makes notes in a small book he carries. The judge responds with the following:

>Whatever exists, he said. Whatever in creation exists without my knowledge exists without my consent.

>These anonymous creatures, he said, may seem little or nothing in the world. Yet the smallest crumb can devour us. Any smallest thing beneath yon rock out of men's knowing. Only nature can enslave man and only when the existence of each last entity is routed out and made to stand naked before him will he be properly suzerain of the earth.


Nothing in recent memory so bespeaks man's alienation from nature,
and because of that alienation the ensuant violence that attends our presence on this earth,
as though we ourselves are somehow alien to the world,
purposeless,
more impotent than an ant in the necessities of the planet and its natural system.
This is all we need to understand.
If we could grasp this one thing,
life here would be so much better. 



There was a time when humanity knew better,
a simpler time,
but that ended with mass human organization,
the will to power and control first over other human beings,
and when that was transferred to the collective farce we call democracy,
the will to power over nature first and then the stars themselves.
Fear and control are first cousins,
just as life and death are the brothers Cain and Abel.


The human family is being run into the ground because we cannot perceive clearly,
cannot surrender our lives to the processes here in love and trust,
can't uncenter ourselves from our malignant cosmology,
passed from one generation to the next like a virus.
We have been deceived.
Somewhere in our life path as a species the controllers of our reality
&mdash;
and we do have controllers
&mdash;
decided they didn't even want to engage us anymore.
It was decided that the human race would be set in another reality under theirs,
and they would be invisible to us,
but always present in human affairs.


We are like children in a playpen with the adults going in and out of the room.
The average human being is so disconnected from reality now this story is going to feel like electric shock therapy.
This story is going to alarm and disturb you precisely because it's going to attempt a realignment of your perception.
I'm going to show you what's really going on here,
and it's not going to be pleasant.
I'm not telling my story to disturb you.
I'm not a shock performer like Marilyn Manson.
There's nothing really shocking about my story.
The shock will come through the realization of the false reality you've been living within,
the womb of imagination that's so comfortable you don't want to be born.
You don't want to come out of it,
but we have to because if we don't,
and soon,
we will destroy ourselves,
the planet,
or both.





People like me don't always get to tell our stories.
We're usually dead by the time we have the maturity to tell them.
I've lived fast and hard in every way,
physically,
emotionally,
mentally,
and spiritually.
I've been an Operations Officer SEAL Team THREE, 
and an Action Officer, 
Special Operations Command,
Hawaii,
among many assignments,
a mercenary,
A *Tata*  and *Nkesa* of the Nganga,
Holder of the Pot,
in the Palo Mayombe religion
&mdash;
the blackest of magic,
the dark side of Santeria
&mdash;
a confidante of Billy Meier and the Plejeran group he heads in Switzerland,
a businessman,
a husband,
and a father.
I've been here and I've been there,
turning over every stone in my path to look underneath it,
a kind of Judge Holden in my own way.


Whatever they make of me when I finally pass over to the other side,
the one thing they will not accuse me of is failing to live.
I love this life,
and I make no apologies for myself or my decisions,
but I can't watch this shit show anymore.
I have to tell my story,
and I have to tell it now,
just a couple years shy of my sixth decade.
It's a miracle I'm still alive,
and I'm going to make it count.



Why now?
Why am I telling my story now?
I have no choice.
When the heart turns the heart turns,
and my heart turned.
Love came to my heart,
real love,
not romance,
not sentiment,
not a Hallmark card,
real love.
It just entered my heart,
and when I felt it I never wanted to feel anything else.
It was a gift given to me by a Hawaiian Kahuna.
He took pity upon me and touched my heart so the door would open,
so I would stop feeling like I had to control everything.
Something loves us,
all of us,
the good and the bad,
and it finally found me.


I've lived most of my life in very dark places,
literally unimaginable darkness for most people
&mdash;
combat theaters,
black magic rituals,
under extraterrestrial surveillance,
and in meetings of the very real Committee of Three Hundred: [^1]

[^1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_300

>The Committee of 300, also known as The Olympians, is a group alleged to have been founded by the British aristocracy in 1727. Proponents of the theory alleging the Committee's existence believe it to be an international council that organizes politics, commerce, banking, media, and the military for centralized global efforts.

I've summoned the devil himself,
and I'm not half joking.
I've walked among the most powerful people on this planet,
and I've seen the beings behind them,
and they're not of this planet.
Many people in public space try to explain what's going on in this world.
I've heard a hundred and one moronic theories.
Some people get close,
but that's not good enough.
To really understand what's happening you have to get it completely right.
It's like a bread recipe
&mdash;
get it just a little bit wrong and the bread doesn't rise.


It's crazy out there now,
crazy in the information field.
There's a lot of intelligence,
but it's not good intelligence because it's often wrong or contextually inaccurate.
You can't run a proper operation without precise intelligence.
Miss your landing spot by three clicks and your mission is compromised.
Public space has been liberated by the Internet.
Podcasters compete with the mainstream.
At every step we lose more context.
The mainstream doesn't know anything,
and,
if they did,
they wouldn't tell you.
Our corporate media is more controlled than Pravda was at the height of the Cold War.
The newspapers usually get the movie start times right,
but not much else.
The podcasters and YouTube channels are throwing darts blindfolded,
and they probably couldn't get a bullseye if they had their eyes open.
It's a shit show.


The religious people want their prophecies proved out
&mdash;
hurry up and destroy the world god or I'm going to stop believing in you
&mdash;
and nobody's really stopped to consider the dilemma.
The expectations of the religious people are so high,
if nothing happens something has happened.
It's a dry powder keg beside a cook fire. 


Here's the truth.
I'm going to give it you once real simple,
but don't worry,
I'm going to spend the rest of the book proving it to you.
You live in a world that is completely owned by dark entities that are not of the earth.
They are foreigners in the most literal sense.
They don't think like us.
They sure as hell don't feel like us,
but they do look like us.
You'd have a hard time picking one out at the mall,
but if you met one you'd spend a week trying to pinpoint what was off about them,
and you'd never get it.

They are human in their manifested appearance.
I call them the controllers.
I've seen them in rooms with the most powerful people in the world.
I don't know what they are.
I'll tell you everything I know about them in the course of this story.
I'm far from a perfect human being.
I've got blood on my hands,
from both active military duty in the Navy Special Warfare teams,
and from the private sector,
where I contracted out as a mercenary.
I willfully walked into the darkest circles on this planet,
and I willfully walked into the darkest circles on the other side of life.
I make no judgments upon myself.
I learned what I needed to learn and moved on with my life.
I went into the darkness voluntarily,
and I left the darkness voluntarily.

A lot of the things I have to tell you might sound bat shit crazy,
but they're true,
and you need to hear them.
The gap between how this world actually operates and how people think it operates is so enormous I'm not even sure it can be filled,
but I have to try.
I have decided that the best way to tell my story is directly.
I can't spend a lot of time trying to convince you what I'm saying is true.
Some people are going to know from the outset that what I'm saying is true because they've had experiences similar to mine,
but they might never have had a context to put them into.
I'm hoping my story can be a context for them to understand the worlds within which they live.
Some people have never had these otherworldly experiences,
never seen the dead,
and to those people I say
&mdash;
please stay with my story nonetheless.
You will not believe where it goes.



I assure you the most powerful politicians and rulers in the world believe in the spirit world.
I assure you that they consort with the darkest of spirits and extraterrestrials to consolidate their power on this planet,
or they are the proxy or puppet of someone who does.
Even if you don't believe what I'm saying,
please try to remember that these people I'm going to tell you about,
they believe it.
If they're writing the policies and laws which govern your life,
then you're living under the umbrella of their spiritual doctrine whether you realize it or not.
The spiritual reality is inescapable.
You either engage it yourself or live under someone's interpretation of it.
There are no other options.
The world you live in is a fairy tale.
The objective and rational world of science that has destroyed the human imagination is exactly what they wanted to create.


The name of the game here is energy harvesting,
and the more spiritually ignorant you're the easier it is to do.
Do you think it's an accident that the world has evolved into this spiritually vacant culture?
It's not an accident.
Every step of the journey to bring us to where we are now in the early part of the twenty-first century was planned centuries ago.
This is what the initiates of the dark side call the *great work*.
We are now living in the middle of the great work.
You are completely surrounded by electromagnetic radiation that affects the veil between this world and the next.
You call it Wi-Fi,
smart phones,
and radio waves.
It's eroding your aura.
It's breaking you down.
They want to break you down.
Their power is derived by sacrificing human beings to the dark lords they serve on the other side.
The whole world has become a ritual.




At its core,
this whole system is nothing more than an economy,
a *quid pro quo*,
but not the economy you might first think,
the economy of commodities,
currencies,
goods and services.
No.
That's the cover story.
The economy is children,
blood,
and psychic energy.
The children are used for sex and sacrifices,
pedophilia and literal blood sacrifices.
The blood sacrifices are larger.
They happen in wars,
like the one hundred and fifty thousand Iraqi soldiers retreating from the front line in 1992 with white flags held high,
all of them mowed down under George Bush's orders.
That's a blood sacrifice.
You can call it war,
but,
like I said,
when you know them,
when you know what they believe,
when you know what they practice,
and when you know what they worship,
you can't kid yourself anymore.
You can't see it as anything but what it is
&mdash;
blood sacrifice.
The psychic energy from the general population is being harvested all the time.
It happens at sporting events,
rock concerts,
and when you watch movies.
Some of the invisible entity classes like to frustrate your thinking and feeling.
When you lose control of your emotions in anger or despair,
they're right there,
harvesting your energy the way you and I would squeeze oranges to make orange juice.


The dark priests offer up something to the spirits and extraterrestrials on the other side,
and the spirits and extraterrestrials on the other side give the dark priests power and riches in this physical world.
Remember,
it's an economy,
inter-dimensional trade if you will,
and inter-species as well when you account for the extraterrestrials.
Get all the nonsense about heaven and hell out of your head.
Religions are consciousness templates put into you by the controllers for energy harvesting.
It's been going on for millennia,
but their economy is truly on a gigantic scale now.
The controllers have never been more powerful than they are now.
The reason is we've been dumbed down and our spiritual defenses have been taken away from us.
Once this problem is corrected,
it will be much harder for them to operate,
provided we're not too late.
We human beings,
especially in the West,
are raised on hero tales in which good always prevails over bad,
but the reality is that's not always how it happens,
and,
when stories that contradict the fundamental mythology occur,
they're very often ignored,
scrubbed from history.


The childish notions of religious ideas have to be abandoned and we as a collective species,
the human race,
have to know and understand what's really going on on this planet,
how it operates,
and why it operates the way it does.
The morals and ethics from religions are important.
Please don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.
If we don't understand where they get their power,
we will never be able to counter that power.
We will never be able to turn the tide in this spiritual war,
and we will never be able to restore balance and harmony to this planet.



The negative must stay in human affairs.
The negative is a teacher of sorts.
If the negative principalities didn't exist we would not evolve.
They're a catalyst.
The most important thing you can do is stop looking at negativity in a fearful way.
The fear has engorged the system of control.
If it weren't for negativity,
we would still be in a very undeveloped state,
and if we harness the very negative circumstance I describe in this book correctly,
we could slingshot to a new level of awareness as a species,
a new context,
and that would be beautiful.


Is it fair that were born into a world where we have none of the animal defenses of the mammals that hunt in forests and jungles?
Why are so many difficulties put upon human beings?
Why is consciousness present to such a high degree in the human being on this planet?
Why do bipedal hominids evolve as the sentient life-form in most of the universe?
What is the role of sentience?
These are the questions that you have to ask yourself.
The way out of this mess is to become more scientific about your spiritual life.
Stop believing things.
Look and know things.
I've done this all my life and it's made all the difference for me.



I don't want to live in the darkness anymore,
but I am grateful for what it taught me.
I was highly functional in that world.
I had natural gifts.
You could see them from a very young age.
Those gifts can be seen by others,
even before those who have them understand them themselves.
That's how a lot of people find their life paths.
They're intercepted by agents of the darkness because they have a gift.
I'm going to burn the world down in these pages.
Everything you believe is going to get torched.
It's an act of mercy,
like lightning starting a forest fire so the forest floor can remineralize itself from the ashes.
Like all stories,
mine must begin at the beginning,
so let's get to it.
