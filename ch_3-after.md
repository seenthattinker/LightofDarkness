After Bell Gardens
===================


A man started courting my mother when I was twelve years old.
The first time he came over to our house he brought ice cream.
I had never had ice cream.
Can you believe that?
Twelve years old and I had never had ice cream.
My brother and sister and I finished off the entire tub of ice cream while he waited for my mother.
We must have looked as desperate as we were.
My brother was fourteen,
so we didn't need a babysitter.
I guess us scarfing down the ice cream told him everything he needed to know.
He took one look around and did what was needed.
He bought groceries the next day.
He could see the emaciated desperation in us kids,
the lack of nutrition,
the ratty clothes,
the general need.
He stood up and took responsibility.
I never felt anything but love from him.
He treated us like we were his children. 
My biological dad loved us,
too.
He was just deployed at sea a lot,
and an alcoholic and a womanizer,
but imperfect people can love too.
You have to go really dark in this world for creation's love to abandon you.
Believe me,
I know.


The man who brought ice cream the first time we met him and groceries the next day got us out of Bell Gardens.
I went to high school in Orange County,
a much nicer school district and area of California.
It was laid back with Huntington Beach and surfers and pretty girls,
not that I cared.
I was as chaste as could be.
I was a Mormon through and through.
Where I was a victim in Bell Gardens,
I was a gangster in Orange County.
The kids there could smell the street on me.
They didn't have beginnings like me
&mdash;
racial beatings from Latinos,
a knife held to my throat,
scary streets to walk at midnight when I was seven years old,
unattended by a mother distracted by her own pain and loss,
malnutrition and poverty
&mdash;
no,
nothing like my beginning.
In my new neighborhood,
I was the scary guy.
If anyone looked at me wrong I told them to fuck off.
Nobody stepped up to me.
These kids were the guilty white progenitors of political correctness.
California was way ahead in this *progressive* nonsense.


In Orange County I bulked up and played football.
I also did track and field.
I used to love to go the gym.
I think now it was the fear I had bottled up.
Every moment I pushed myself,
caused myself pain,
sweated,
and changed my body by will,
I was confronting my fear.
The sports stayed with me for quite a while.
I played college sports as well.
Orange County was a little bit of normal in my developmental years.
I thank my stepfather for it.

My fascination with god continued.
It got stronger the older I got.
I read everything I could get my hands on related to god,
all the while staying a Mormon
&mdash;
no tobacco,
alcohol,
coffee or tea.
It wasn't easy doing that in the seventies.
All the kids were drinking and smoking pot and having sex.
I taught myself transcendental meditation.
I was looking for a way out of the world.
That's the only way I can explain it.
I wasn't suicidal.
That's not what I mean.
I wanted into the worlds the spirits came from. 
I knew by what I had been seeing since I was a child that other worlds existed.
It's where the spirits lived.
I wanted to go there.
I wanted to see these other worlds.

I was always restless,
always imagining adventures for myself.
Through the Mormon Church,
I managed to do my last year of high school in Salt Lake City,
Utah.
The Mormons are very connected that way.
We can all debate theology,
but there is no debating the warmth and family of Mormon culture.
I stayed with different families,
and I worked evenings and weekends in a restaurant.
I just couldn't wait to get out on my own.
Seventeen years was enough with my mother.
I needed to spread my wings and fly. 
Nothing eventful happened in Utah.
I mark it in the story as the beginning of my independence.


After finishing high school in Utah,
I went back home to work with my stepdad in a plating shop.
We worked on chemical tanks for plating gold,
nickel,
brass.
It was in this time that I made up my mind to go on a mission for the Mormon Church.
I went to Ogden,
Utah for the months of training to prepare me for the mission.
The church didn't want to let me do a mission at first because my parents didn't go to church with me.
I convinced them anyways,
and I got a two year mission in St Louis,
Missouri.

I had some fascinating experiences on my mission.
I really don't know know if it was just because my mind was so focused on god,
but I had a number of paranormal experiences on mission.
One time I went into a church to speak with a minister.
He wasn't a Mormon.
He was an evangelical.
He had two cherub statues and they turned and looked at me while I was in his church.
That night I went back to my mission dormitory with my colleagues,
as I always did.
Something followed me back from the desolated church where I had spoken with the severely dejected and beaten pastor.
The door kept opening and slamming.
There was nobody there.
My roommates and I started to get a little freaked out.
I later found out that the pastor at that church had lost his whole congregation.
Some evil had gotten into his life and taken him over.
He didn't realize what was going on.
Most people having experiences with the negative agents in life are often unconscious of it.
We weren't able to help him.
He didn't want to be baptized in the Mormon Church.



There is no hierarchy to god or churches and beliefs.
I'm not suggesting our Mormon grace was higher than his.
Very often religions represent stages of our unfoldment,
as the Mormon Church did for me as a child and a young man.
I was in my early twenties when I went to St. Louis.
It's very important that you note my spiritual evolution as I tell the story.
It is the story.
I attended a number of exorcisms with the Mormon Church.
I heard voices come out of bodies,
move around a room disembodied,
then go into the corner and cackle this Mormon Church laughter before leaving.
All the people in the exorcism with me heard the same thing.
It was an objective experience.
They're not really demons.
The whole religious lie is a dysphemism.
Remember Marcus Aurelius
&mdash;
*This thing, 
what is it in itself, 
in its own constitution? 
What is its substance and material?*
In most instances they're just dead humans close to this world,
looking to enjoy some alcohol or tobacco,
or something else they miss.
But not always.
I'll talk abut the other stuff that gets into people later in the story.


I guess we go through things in life to build a foundation,
like grade school,
but that doesn't excuse the widespread lies and falsehoods in religion,
and they are lies.
Maybe not at the low level,
but at the top of all these religions they know what's going on.
That's why the Vatican is talking about our space brothers.
They're just another shit show.
Even though the Mormon religion is largely false,
they do have a jurisdiction and a domain,
and they do help a lot of people.
What most people don't know is the activities and symbols you get involved with in the religion attract the negative entities to begin with.
Then a steward of the religion does something to dispel the negativity.
You have a supernatural experience and you end up believing more in the religion.
It's the ultimate form of self-fulfilling prophecy.
Everybody is in on it.
The Catholics are in on it,
the Protestants,
and the Mormons are sure as shit in on it.



Negativity always contracts consciousness.
It likes to put you in a space you don't step outside.
It does this through fear.
If you behave this way you will become possessed by demons.
It's a vicious cycle.
It pivots off of phenomenon.
Remember,
I'm not saying that entities don't posses or influence people,
quite the opposite.
Most people on the planet are affected by entities,
disembodied spiritual entities or beings who,
for one reason or another,
have no mobility on the other side,
are unable to ascend or move,
and end up cohabitating with people.
It's epidemic on this planet.
It's easy to fix,
though,
and most times you've just had your free will usurped through some trick,
some consent you gave to something.
Revoke consent and it ends.
There's no money in that,
though,
no cash to build churches and buy children for depraved sexual purposes,
no psychiatry,
no pharmaceutical industry,
no opportunity to fuck with humanity,
which is what these agents of chaos,
these controllers and their human *familiars* want.


The only real commodity on this planet from the perspective of the other dimensions and the beings and entities therein is us.
We're the prize,
our energy,
our connection to creation,
our spirit.
That's what they want,
and they'll do anything to access and control it.
If cows were conscious would you tell them they were being raised to be harvested?
Of course not.
They'd bolt in the night and take their chances in the wild,
forego the hay bails and salt licks and live independently.
It's really that simple.
Religion is part of the control grid.
They fool us by controlling phenomenon.
They have the answer for the shadowy figure in your bedroom at night,
the answer for why you're having bad dreams.
Leave the pasture.
The shepherd is going to harvest you.
All you're looking for is love,
because what created you did so out of love,
and when you give and accept love you celebrate your own creation,
the entirety of creation,
and the creator itself,
but,
as you can tell from my story,
we have to cycle through these belief systems for personal and social reasons.
My association with the Mormon Church went long into my adult life.






It was after my mission in St Louis that I went to college. 
I started out in a junior college. 
From there I went to Brigham Young University in Provo, 
Utah, 
and from there I transferred to Brigham Young University in Hawaii. 
It was in Hawaii that I was introduced to the nightmarchers [^4]. 



They started trying to communicate with me and to touch me.


>In Hawaiian legend, Nightmarchers are the deadly ghosts of ancient Hawaiian warriors.

>On the nights honoring the Hawaiian gods Kane, Ku, Lono, or on the nights of Kanaloa they are said to come forth from their burial sites, or to rise up from the ocean, and to march in a large group to ancient Hawaiian battles sites or to other sacred places. Legend says the nightmarchers are normal-size warriors, dressed for battle, carrying spears, clubs, and some are beating war drums and blowing tones from conch shells, to announce the advancing of their march. Legend also says they are suspended in the air; their feet do not touch water or ground as they traverse through the night, and they leave no evidence of their visitations.

>They march in darkness after sunset, and march as a group continuously until just before sunrise. Anyone living along their path may hear chanting, sounds of blown conch shell tones, and marching noise in the night. Mortals must go inside immediately, lay prone on the floor, and not look up to avoid notice from the Nightmarchers, in fear of harm or even death. Nightmarchers might appear during the day if coming to escort a dying relative to the spirit world.


I would hear a voice from behind me,
turn,
and nobody would be there.
Sometimes I would feel a finger poke me in the back,
turn,
and nobody would be there.
I spoke to the locals. 
They told me that I was experiencing the nightmarchers.
Because I was still wrapped up in the Mormon Church,
I considered all things like this Mormon Church and they frightened me a little bit.
I guess I was born with this ability to interact with the other side.
It can be taught,
but most people who want to be taught are already having experiences.
Very few people ever come to any understanding of this unless they're born with a natural ability.
You can develop it through meditation,
but even the people who get into that are usually having experiences.
It seems to me the world is a place where people wake up individually.
Some native tribes,
like the Hawaiians and the Australians,
have deep shamanic traditions that allow them to traverse the multiverse.
Most of those cultures were attacked during colonization. 
The Jesuits were tasked with getting the mystical secrets from the shamans.
Many of the shamans were tortured and killed.
The Vatican was the occult wing of the European expansion. 
The tribes were left bereft of guidance.
It's an undocumented part of our history.
The Jesuits and the Knights of Malta have always been the military wings of the Vatican.





Whatever happened while I was getting my business degree in Hawaii,
I fell in love with the place.
I live in Hawaii now.
After I finished with college
&mdash;
about a year short of my degree
&mdash;
I went back to Los Angeles to live with my sister for a while.
She was married,
but she and her husband were fighting all the time.
My mother told me to get out of the house.
I ended up living in my car for an indeterminate period of time.
I was kind of working odd jobs and just sort of ambling through my life without any direction.
This is often characteristic of people who are touched by the other side.
Because we have this other life going on,
it becomes a little bit more difficult for us to focus on the sort of straight line progression of a normal American Life.
I ended working for six months at McDonnell Douglas Aerospace.
My sister hooked me up with a job.
She had already started her progression into corporate America with the genius she inherited from my grandfather.
I hated the corporate world. 
It amazes me people can live that way their whole life.
I guess they do it for their kids,
but for me,
the gerbil cage of the office cubicle was a spiritual death sentence.




I eventually decided that I wanted to enlist.
I was living in Los Angeles at the time.
I went down to the recruitment office and I enlisted for the Navy SEALs.
It was a long shot.
Maybe one in ten applicants gets accepted for training,
and of them maybe twenty percent get through the training.
Some months later I was notified of my acceptance into training.
I couldn't believe it.
I called my stepfather,
and he was happy for me,
but he knew I was only some courses shy of a university degree.
He advised me to enlist as an officer on the promise I would finish my degree before training.
My start date with the navy was pushed back to accommodate my desire to join training as an officer candidate.
Los Angeles is the biggest recruitment center for the US military.
At this time in navy history no one from Los Angeles had been recruited into the officer class of the Navy SEALs.
I was the first.
At the time I wasn't working and I was living in my car.
I don't know why,
maybe it was my upbringing in Bell Gardens,
my emotionally absent mother,
wandering the streets at night,
but I was never afraid of what I looked like to other people.
Being homeless was just another intermittent phase of my life back then. 
It didn't get really cold in Los Angeles.
It was easy to sleep in my car,
wash at the beach,
and eat take-out. 



In the cycle I applied there were nine hundred applications.
Of those ninety candidates were selected.
It was a minor miracle I got in.
The selection pool for officer training was the best of the best,
military academies like Navy Academy and Ivy League graduates from Harvard and Yale,
and some came from other branches of the military.
I was recruited from Los Angeles where I was living homeless in my car.
I think what impressed them was my Mormon Mission because they like commitment and moral character.
No doubt my family and my father,
who was very well-known and well-liked in the US Navy as a Master Chief,
played a determining role as well,
but nepotism only influenced getting the opportunity.
Nothing but you gets through the Navy Special Warfare training.
I had six months to finish my degree.
I signed up for university night courses at the University of Phoenix and drove back and forth from Los Angeles.
I worked part-time in the service industry.
I was run ragged,
operating on about fifteen hours sleep a week,
but I finished my degree and qualified for officer training.
