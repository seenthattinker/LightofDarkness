Navy Special Warfare
====================================

When I got my acceptance for the Navy SEAL training I was ecstatic.
Those who have been through the program usually refer to it as Navy Special Warfare.
The general public knows it as SEAL training.
I was twenty-eight years old when I entered Navy Special Warfare training.
Most of the guys I was with were younger than me.
I didn't have a straight line life like these guys.
They came from disciplined families where they were put on a path and marched it.
The very last thing you want to do at Navy Special Warfare training is stand out.
You want to blend in.
You don't want anything about you that draws attention from the trainers and the other candidates.



My father had originally gone through the progenitor of Navy Special Warfare training in 1954.
It was called UDT,
which stands for Underwater Demolition Team.
He failed.
The actual Navy Special Warfare program was commenced by John F Kennedy.
I know the man who was in the room with Kennedy when the president was describing what he wanted.
Kennedy said that he wanted men who could fight on the sea,
in the air,
and on the land,
and the gentleman who was taking notes said,
Okay then we'll call them SEALs
&mdash;
sea,
air,
land
&mdash;
and that's how the name Navy SEAL began.
What Kennedy envisioned was a completely dedicated commando unit that really wasn't present in the US military at the time.
They would be in a constant state of training,
and they would live out of a duffel bag,
on-call twenty-four seven to deploy for operations.


Training was in Coronado, 
California.
It's a six month program at its core with ongoing training throughout your enlistment.
My class number was one hundred and fifty-six.
We were the first graduating class of 1989.
At that time there were about seven classes a year graduating.
Each class has a graduation level between fifteen and twenty-five,  
A mix of original class starters and roll backs from former classes.  
Most classes started with about one hundred and forty-five candidates.  
If you do the math,
it's well under two hundred graduates a year.
They are the elite of the elite in the US Military,
pure tactical aggression,
the most combat-centric special operators in the game.



If you're injured during Navy Special Warfare training you can stop and start at a later date,
so,
as you're going through the training,
new guys enter your class at the point they became injured.
The only way to get kicked out of the program is to surrender,
which involves ringing a bell. 
If you ring the bell,
you can't come back,
but getting torn up or breaking bones during the training doesn't disqualify you.
You simply have to begin again at the stage of the training where you got injured.
So the motto is,
*don't ring the bell*.

As I went on in my training,
a few guys did cycle in with us at various stages where they had been injured in previous classes.
The hardest thing to do in Navy Special Warfare training is to start and finish with your original class.
The reason is that your body gets so banged up and you get no time to heal.
I was very fortunate to get through it on my first shot,
but I paid a horrible price in pain,
which will be made clear as this part of the story progresses.


On arriving at the training camp,
you go to the quarterdeck and register.
I was a few weeks early.
I was allowed to stay on the base because I was slotted for the next class.
As I moved around and got to know the place,
it was a lot like Mormon culture.
It was very clean living.
I didn't hear any gutter talk about women or anything that I might describe as lewd.
As I got into the culture,
my first impressions were validated.
There's no bravado or indecency is Navy Special Warfare.
If you were found out to have cheated on your wife or girlfriend,
you were treated like a shit bird.
They didn't like it.
The thinking was that if you went on deployment you didn't want any worries about a brother trying to sleep with your wife.
In general,
a high standard of moral living is expected
&mdash;
no promiscuity,
no heavy drinking,
no drugs.
It was a lot like Brigham Young University.


When I trained in 1988,
the Navy Special Warfare team had been whittled down to less than one hundred and thirty members in the aftermath of the Vietnam War.
They had been broken up and sent to other parts of the Navy.
The numbers had been built up for Vietnam,
but that war had been over for a decade and a half.
I had to wait thirty days to start because that's when the next officer class commenced.
When I went through training they were building up again.
I didn't realize it at the time,
but they were building up for war.
It was ten months before the Panama Invasion by George Bush Sr,
and the Iraq incursion,
Desert Storm March 1990.



The training is broken up into three phases over the six months.
Each phase is two months long.
There is no break between phases.
You go right from one to the next.
It's brutal. 
The body has no time to heal.
It's designed to weed out the weak.

The first month is basic physical training.
You do a lot of running,
twelve miles a day in combat boots.
A lot of the runs take place on the beach.
There's a lot of obstacle course work,
but these aren't like the ones you see on those gladiator television shows.
The obstacles can go sixty feet high.
If you fall off,
and people do,
you break whatever you land on,
arm,
leg,
what have you.
So you get used to seeing people falling away right from the beginning of the course.
As I said,
you have the option to try again if you leave by injury.
There's miles of swimming in the ocean.
If you've never swam distance in the ocean,
let me tell you,
it's not easy. 
The waves and rip tides are difficult to navigate,
and you generally move a lot slower than if you were doing laps in a pool. 
I thought I was in good shape when I went there,
but I wasn't.
I was barely making the times.


The purpose of the first month of rigorous training is to prepare you for hell week,
which happens in the fifth week.
If you can't make it through the first four weeks,
then there's no way you're going to make it through the fifth week.
The success rate in the officer training is about sixty percent.
The success rate in the enlisted training is about ten percent.
Remember,
I was in the officer training.
The guys I was going through the program with were graduates of Harvard and Princeton.
I had read *Think and Grow Rich* by Napoleon Hill,
and I was using a lot of the techniques in the book,
visualization and things like this.
My whole being had begun to center itself on the task before me.
I was way out of my league among these other Ivy Leaguers who were going through the Navy Special Warfare training.
They were younger guys who had done everything by the book:
started university right after high school,
finished on time,
and were ready to go into the Navy Special Warfare training in their early twenties.
I was the old man of the group.
Every added year makes the physical test more difficult.
In terms of endurance and strength a human being might be at their strongest around twenty-five years old,
and it's just downhill from there.

The training for the entire six months is Monday to Friday.
You get weekends off.
The first thing you have to get used to are the instructors.
They are all Navy Special Warfare themselves.
There are no words to describe these guys.
If you get on their bad side,
which is usually done by some kind of defiance,
your world goes to hell fast.
They'll break you.
They'll find a way to break you and get you out of the training.
Obedience is the number one rule.
We're treated like dogs.
That's the whole point of training.
It's to break down your individuality so you can fit into the team and be counted on in the most dire of circumstances.
Of course,
not everybody understands this at the outset.
One fellow ran afoul of the instructors in the first week I was there.
The story I heard was he borrowed one of the instructors cars and crashed it and told the instructor to go fuck himself.
What I saw happen to that guy was horrible.
They extend the training.
They bring you to a point where you go and you ring the bell.
When you see your first person cut from the training it becomes real.
You know this is a contact sport and not everybody is getting out of it clean.
Well,
nobody is going to get out of it clean and without injuries,
but some are not going to make it at all.
Watching these instructors go on the guy who crashed the car was like watching the Hell's Angels beat the crap out of somebody.
They were hardcore in every way.
At the time I went through the Navy Special Warfare training most of the instructors were Vietnam vets.
They had very little leeway for levity.
That's the kindest way I can put it.

We started training with rubber rafts in the first month.
We had to learn how to paddle and ride the surf in them.
This was leading up to hell week where the rubber raft is central.
In part of the training area there were these big rocks in front of the water to break the surf.
We would have to ride the rafts at high tide into the rocks and then carry the rafts up over the rocks.
I saw guys break their legs.
Throughout all of this you push so hard that people do die.
Not every class,
but I was told that just a couple classes before me two guys had died in Navy Special Warfare training.
At the end of every day at around five o'clock,
which is my best guess,
we were told where to be the next day,
but we were never told what we were going to be doing.
That was always kept from us.
They didn't want us prepared for what the day's activities were going to be.
On the weekends different guys would do different things.
Some guys would quietly read.
I had one guy I went through camp with who always had a book in his hands,
Ernest Hemingway,
TS Eliot,
a very literate guy.
He would also drive every weekend when we had leave.
He was from the east coast and had never seen the west.
He wanted to see stuff,
so he would drive out to Yosemite and the Grand Canyon and things like this.
I became kind of the opposite of the man I was before I entered into Navy Special Warfare.
I would go out drinking on the weekends.
So I got a little bit away from my Mormon roots.
Throughout all of this we would also be doing some intellectual training as well.
We had to learn to work with various types of explosives and set charges and things like this.
There was also hand to hand combat training,
what we called SCARS in Navy Special Warfare.
This was not sport martial arts where you were learning to make points.
These are all pressure points and places on the human body where if you hit once the person is not going to be able to survive.
And all of this was leading up to hell week.
