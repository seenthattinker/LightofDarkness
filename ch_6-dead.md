Dead Man Walking
======================


If you've been following the story so far you'll know that I died twice
&mdash; 
once when the knife was put to my throat in Bell Gardens,
and again when my spirit left my body in hell week.
I've had numerous near-death experiences besides those two.
Near-death experiences are fairly well documented.
They happen in hospitals quite a bit.
The first time I left my body was when I was a kid in Bell Gardens.
My vantage point on the entire scene changed.
I wasn't looking out my eyes with a knife at my throat.
I was beside and above the whole situation,
detached from everything.
I knew it was me on the street with a knife cutting my throat.
I could see my neighbors running out and yelling at the culprit.
I could see the confusion in his face.
I could see my street,
my neighborhood,
cones of light from the street lamps,
and all of it was in its right place.
The moment the guy let go of me and took the knife away from my throat,
I went back into my body.
It was like it never happened to me.
The only thing to remind me that it did happen was the blood on my shirt and the stinging on my throat.
The assailant split skin but he didn't cut deeply into my throat.
My trachea and arteries were fine.
There was no threat to my life.
I remember my neighbors cleaning me up.
The cut was too shallow for stitches,
so they put a few bandages on my neck.
Everybody was in shock,
everybody except me.
My neighbors told me I was a very brave boy.
I remember the fear in their faces.


I couldn't tell anyone I'd been out of my body looking at the whole event and a cushion of peace insulated me from the horror of what was going on.
It was a monumental event for a kid as young as me at the time.
I didn't tell anybody,
not my mother,
my brother,
or my sister.
I would have gotten into serious trouble for being out so late at night.
Imagine that,
a little kid with a knife to his throat and leaving his body.



Every time you leave your body under duress something comes back with you.
A little part of the other side stays with you.
I've never been through any of the government trauma programs,
but I know about them.
Deliberate trauma goes far back in the human record. 
The compartmentalization I describe in the Navy Special Warfare training is what happens in these trauma-based mind control programs,
but,
unlike when it happens naturally through intense physical exertion,
or through the shock of having a knife put to your throat,
these people who go through the programs lead horrible lives.
They never get whole.
They're like pieces of a person glued back together.
You can almost see the seams.


The programs begin in Montreal,
Quebec.
They were run as a CIA covert program out of Allan Memorial Institute McGill University.[^5]
The man in charge was named Doctor Ewan Cameron,
a ghoul of a man.

[^5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_experiments

>The Montreal experiments were a series of experiments, initially aimed to treat schizophrenia by changing memories and erasing the patients' thoughts using Donald Ewen Cameron's method of “psychic driving” as well as drug-induced sleep, intensive electroconvulsive therapy, sensory deprivation and Thorazine. The experiments were conducted at the Allan Memorial Institute of McGill University between 1957 and 1964 by the Scottish psychiatrist Donald Ewen Cameron and funded by the CIA as part of Project MK Ultra, which lasted until 1973 and was only revealed to the public in 1975.

>The patients of this experiment, who were mainly diagnosed with depression or schizophrenia expected positive changes from Cameron's treatment. However, these patients suffered severely under conditions that are not in accordance with the human rights. Not only the patients but also their families show long lasting effects on their mental health. Some of these symptoms include retrograde amnesia as well as impairments in every day life abilities such as self-care.

>To this day, the topic of the experiments of Montreal has been kept in the dark by the CIA, who actively prevent information about these experiments from being leaked to the public, whether that be through destruction of files or signing non-disclosure agreements.

That was just the beginning.
The victims and their families sued the Canadian government. 
They were compensated.
It didn't end there.
A class-action lawsuit was launched at the beginning of 2019.[^6]
This one,
filed in the Province of Quebec,
names the US Attorney General as a defendant.

[^6]: https://www.clg.org/pdf/1/2/3/1/Application-for-Authorization.pdf

>The project in Montreal was one in which psychiatric patients, hospitalized for
a variety of different reasons, were subjected to a series of procedures that
involved the use of experimental drugs, intensive shock treatments, sensory
deprivation, forced sleep for weeks on end and the use of recorded voices for
hours at a time in order to bring about behaviour change. These procedures,
designed to manufacture new lives for those on whom they were applied, only
succeeded in destroying the lives which they had led. For some, these
techniques so changed their basic sense of self that what was left appeared
unrecognizable to those who loved them.


That was in the middle of the twentieth century.
All this stuff started with the Nazis
&mdash;
*I hate Hitler!*.
My grandfather was a very dark guy.
Some negativity got deep inside of him and just burrowed and burrowed right to his soul.
It amazes me people like that can keep going.
It would seem a natural conclusion would be suicide,
but no.
Darkness has its own light.
Jacob Boehme[^7] was right.


[^7]: Six Theosophic Points by Jacob Boehme.

>It is not to be thought that the life of darkness is sunk in misery and lost as if in sorrowing. There is no sorrowing. For sorrow is a thing that is swallowed up in death, and death and dying are the very life of the darkness.

The *human potential* programs,
my euphemism for MK Ultra,
were the byproduct of the Nazis,
who were themselves the byproduct of the extraterrestrials through the Thule society and the Vril society,
both of which were the product of telepathic communication and technology from Semjase,
a Plejeran working with the Germans between the two world wars.
This will be discussed in the Plejeran chapter.

All of nature is perfect.
Only man,
the observer,
the transcendent aspect of nature,
sees a fault in it.
The fault lies in our perception,
our attachment to the body,
our meager physical life,
and our fear of the unknown.
Also,
the way the creator set up man and nature makes man the heir of predation in his thoughts and feelings.
There is no thought of guilt when a jaguar kills a pig in the rainforest.
The jaguar is no more capable of guilt than the pig is of victim consciousness.
Man,
the observer,
becomes the expression of both the guilt and the victimization,
and then,
to make it even more comical,
the lawyers come in to assert damages.
It's a shit show.
In human affairs,
a new protocol is added to nature
&mdash;
consent.
The day will come when moneyed serial killers will obtain consent before the torture,
rape,
murder,
then consumption
&mdash;
cannibalization
&mdash;
of victims,
and the law will permit it.
In many ways, it does now,
but humanity is so far removed from what these ghouls are doing nobody yet exists to contest their Frankenstein experiments.
The Canadian court cases,
both the one already won in Canada and the one commenced against the US Attorney General,
are the first I know of.
It will be very difficult to go further into the military-scientific experiments on humanity because they went underground,
both literally and figuratively.
The literal part is the vast international underground world that exists now,
connected by high-speed trains we don't have above ground,
so fast you can go from Los Angeles to Sydney, 
Australia is less than an hour.
Most of the really dark experiments are done underground now.
The figurative part of the underground is the human population used.
They create their own children now,
unregistered and unknown in the world.
And they set up orphanages to have a steady supply of children nobody will inquire about.
It's not just the experiments for which the children are used.
They are also used in a vast,
international pedophilia ring that is so big now I'm amazed they can even hide it.
More on that in a future chapter.


Consent is a very tricky thing to understand in the modern world.
These law ghouls have so confounded the free will dynamic on the planet we're practically in a state of constant consent.
The moment you're born in the developed world you're *conscripted*.
The birth certificate essentially registers you as the property of the state.
Because we forfeit our sovereignty at birth we are the property of the state.
They don't come right out and say it,
but it's there.
This is how they did the experiments in Montreal. 
The people were wards of the state.
If you want a general rule to find the dark centers in society,
look to the places where people go in states of surrender and need
&mdash;
psychiatric hospitals,
orphanages,
old age homes,
anywhere people are separated from the love of family and friends.
The old age homes are used for euthanasia.
That should be clear now with the virus and quarantine.
When they kill the old people they don't have to pay social security.
That's how they manage their contractual obligations.
See what happens if you don't file your income taxes.
You'll go to jail,
another place they experiment on people.


Our society has become so dark that ghouls fit in now.
We have been conditioned to accept the ghoul.
What started in Montreal never ended.
It goes on today.
Shit went dark.
Everyone read into the program holds the secret like a Mormon Temple oath,
or a Masonic pledge.
The bullshit rationalizations are endless.
It's a shit show.
My grandfather saw it all start in Germany.
All this crap in its modern form came out of Nazi experiments. 
*I hate Hiler!*


I brought back abilities from the other side.
The near-death experience as a kid started something.
Once you've had one it's much easier to have more.
It's kind of like dislocating your shoulder.
If you do it once,
there's a high chance you're going to do it throughout your life.
The ball in the socket gets loose somehow and your shoulder just pops out from time to time.
It's the same thing with near-death experiences.
I could see things that other people couldn't see.
It was especially acute in graveyards.
You'd be amazed at how many spirits hang around in graveyards and hospitals.
I could see into people.
I describe it as looking inside their head.
I could see their hopes,
their fears,
their past,
the things that had traumatized them,
the things which were holding them back from new perspectives on life,
all of it out there for me to see like a deck of cards spread out on a table.
That's why the nightmarchers recognized me in Hawaii.

The second sight is a two-way street.
Where I could see inside of people and I could see aspects of the other side of life,
others on the other side of life could see me,
and they knew I could see them.
It was a very strange ability to have as a young child and to grow up with.
I could see what my mother was thinking,
what my sister was thinking,
what my brother was thinking,
what my school teachers were thinking.
Thoughts don't manifest as words.
Images form the language.
I saw it all.
Language is just an interpretation of an event.
I saw the events themselves.
Things started to visit me at night.
I would wake up in my bedroom and there would be figures.
They were just standing there looking at me while I slept.
Strangely,
I was never afraid.
From the moment I popped out of my body with that knife to my throat I entered a new reality.
It became my new normal.
The white-out in Navy Special Warfare training taught me that there were many ways to do this.
Governments and secret societies and cults have been doing this since the beginning of time.
The excessive meditation of Tibetan training is a form of mind control and trauma-based conditioning.
We don't call it that because people aren't abused the way they are in the MK Ultra programs,
but they are trauma-based.
To sit and meditate for four hours is a form of trauma upon yourself.
The goal is to awaken the inner perception by shutting down the senses and disengaging the mind without going to sleep.
That is the entirety of spiritual practice as simple as anybody is ever going to put it for you.
Religions are what children are given when they're raised in families so they never ask the questions and never begin the journey that will lead to spiritual awakening.
Religions are spiritual placebos to keep consciousness in the womb.
They're forms of mass mind control.

I was a kind of dead man walking in Navy Special Warfare.
I started in Fort Benning,
Georgia, 
for jump training,
then I went to the SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team Two at the Amphibious Base,
Norfolk,
Virginia.
I didn't have my trident yet.
That's your pin.
We called it the Budweiser.
There's no time limit to get it.


For my first six months they sent me to ten different schools for further training.
One was called *unconventional warfare*.
It was a series of lectures in Florida.
A four-star general described in detail what it was like on the Bataan Death March in World War II across the Philippines.
The Japanese were brutal.
If you fell back one or two steps at the back of the line they would just stab you and leave you on the side of the road to bleed out.
It was all senior officers.
I was probably the youngest guy there.
I heard another lecture from a guy who was involved in the operation to rescue the American hostages in Iran under Carter.
That mission completely fell apart.
The helicopters weren't ready for dealing with sandstorms.
I got an intense sense of what can go wrong in a planned operation from these lectures.
I had a lecture from a CIA guy while I was there. 
That was my first encounter with the CIA. 
It would not be my last.
The CIA is the most pervasive intelligence service,
in every corner and crevice of the world,
and into the solar system and the galaxy through extraterrestrial connections.
I'll get into that more as my story unfolds.


There was another lecture about the war on drugs.
I was fascinated by this lecture.
Afterward, I went up to the lecturer and I asked him,
how long before the war is won?
He gave me a very funny look and didn't answer my question directly.
I asked two or three more times and his final answer was,
We're working on it.
The message was there was no intent to win the war on drugs.
In short time we would be in Panama grabbing Manuel Noriega's piggy bank,
the cartel money he banked for them.
That's what Panama was all about.
Noriega was an account *El CIA* closed. 
Noriega,
despite all his prostrations to the Vatican,
who ultimately sheltered him,
was a practitioner of Santeria. 
That's why the news kept reporting evidence of black magic as the troops trailed Noriega through the towns and mountain pueblos of Panama
&mdash;
a dead chicken in the center of a chalk drawing.
We cornered him in a Jesuit monastery and blared Van Halen until he came out.
Noriega loved classical music.
He was a classy guy under the pock faced little thug demeanor. 
Noriega and the Panama invasion was when George Bush took over the drug trade.
I can assure you,
George Bush's real wealth was more than a trillion dollars when he died,
if,
in fact,
he died at all.



As I moved around these high-level intelligence and military people,
I could not read their thoughts.
Something was blocking me.
I was able to see inside of people's heads for the most part.
But in these circles,
no.
They were guarded,
protected,
something was keeping them outside of my view.
But,
as is so often the case in this two-way street,
they,
for reasons I never quite understood,
knew that I had consciousness and perception abilities capable of seeing thoughts and feelings around people and seeing into the other side.
If there's one thing I want to stress in my story,
it's that intelligence and military is not just physical and logistical,
it's occult.
At their core they are occult organizations.

You must remember that at this stage of my story I was still a Mormon.
I was still living the moral purity of a Mormon life.
I'd done a little bit of drinking while I went through the intense part of Navy Special Warfare training.
I went out on weekends and I had a few beers.
Aside from that,
I had not broken any of my covenants with the Mormon faith.
I still didn't drink coffee,
smoke tobacco,
or drink more than a beer at a time.
It's very hard to get along socially in the military world without having a drink from time to time.
My point is,
I was still living the Mormon life and I still had that moral code.
I was like a lamb in a den of wolves.
They must have thought I was some kind of idiot man child that just fell off the back of a turnip truck,
a slightly more articulate and physically capable Forrest Gump.
I simply just didn't fit in with that crowd, 
but they couldn't beat me, 
they couldn't bend me, 
and they couldn't get rid of me.


My commanding officers could see I was bored stiff,
so I was given little things to do.
I was given the combinations to the safes which had all the long-range planning for the teams.
I went through all the plans.
They detail troop buildup and deployment over twenty-five, 
fifty, 
and a hundred years.
The military is constantly scoping out and constantly gaming scenarios.
When I would find myself in a casual situation with a commanding officer,
maybe a meal at the cafeteria or something like this,
I would reference the plans I had read and ask questions.
They couldn't believe I read the plans.
I never got any answers.
Reading the plans and asking questions was not something I was supposed to do.
You have to understand that all independence of mind and thinking is shunned in the military.
I quickly developed a reputation as a shit bird.
They were frustrating the hell out of me on purpose.
Welcome to the US Military,
the greatest bureaucratic nightmare on the planet.
It's one hundred times worse than the Department of Motor Vehicles or the Internal Revenue Service.
It's ironic to me that an organization that prided itself on action was so stifled by bureaucratic procedures.
Later on I would realize it's because most of the operations done by the military,
and here I mean the small team stuff,
is off the books and never really happened.
It's all black box/white box.
It's better that way.
You can never be asked questions about something that never happened.


Finally after six months of this nonsense,
I was put into a training program to operate mini-subs.
I was sent off to San Diego and on my way to getting my trident.
It was kind of a cool program, the mini-sub program.
We trained in very cold water at night.
We had to break the ice to get under the water.
I used to wear three seven millimeter wet suits.
I had a really hard time finishing my training and getting my trident.
Everyone on my team had received their trident already except me.
I finally took it up with command.
I was very polite about it.
He opened the safe,
left his office after looking at me and saying,
The safe is open.
I went into the safe and looked at my training file.
It had all kinds of derogatory comments in it.
I whited them out,
photocopied the original form with the white-out,
then shredded the original and put it all back in the safe.
Shortly after that I received my trident.
When I think back on this I wonder why it was that my team had all these negative comments about me.
I excelled at everything I did.
I was an exceptional operator with the mini-sub.
The only thing I can come up with was I had an innocence,
a naivete,
and a very pure heart.
In the special forces, people don't want to work with a guy like that.
You have to be a little bit hard-hearted to get their trust.
At the end of the day,
these are killers.
Nobody wants a warm-hearted,
honest,
naive guy in the Hell's Angels.
It's the same with the special forces and especially with Navy Special Warfare.
In the end I got my trident.
I was no longer a dead man walking.

Most of my work in Navy Special Warfare was intellectual or related to the mini-subs.
I saw no combat,
not a single firefight in seven and a half years,
at which time I retired due to injuries,
two back operations to be precise,
the result of one leg being a bit longer than the other and the arduous torture I put my body through with the physical training of Navy Special Warfare.
Our lives catch up to us through our bodies.
After Navy Special Warfare I contracted for three years,
mainly with the CIA,
as so many former special forces members do.
I will maintain my oath of confidentiality here because I gave my word,
and holding your word is important,
even if the contract is with the devil,
metaphorically speaking.
I will only say that my work with the CIA was largely intellectual as well.
