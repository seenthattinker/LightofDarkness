Robert Kane
=============================

You would be amazed by how many times our lives come down to one of two things.
It's the way this universe has been set up.
There's nothing in creation that cannot be discovered by a human being.
We have been given the ability to go anywhere.
The human being is a remarkable construction.
There are a lot of people crapping on humanity now.
But we are an extraordinary species.
Don't let anybody tell you differently.
The way human beings have been constructed we are like a skeleton key for every dimension in the universe.
One of the densest realities in all creation and one of the most violent and caustic planets in all of creation,
these things are true.
But what we can achieve in this chaos,
the spiritual opportunity in this cacophony is astounding.
Very few human beings in every generation come to realize what I'm talking about.



Everything in creation is a tell.
It's impossible to create something as a human being and not have it tell us something about the universe.
god tips his hand all the time at the card table.
Let's take computers for example.
They are hands-down one of the most significant achievements of the twentieth century.
They are constructed off of silicon.
They go from simple home computers to supercomputers used by intelligence agencies and the military.
The facsimile of reasoning that a computer undertakes to emulate intelligence is built upon a series of decisions in which the answer can be one of two things.
In computing circles this is known as a Boolean decision.


The expression,
*Boolean*,
is taken from the self-taught English mathematician George Boole.[^14]

[^14]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole


>George Boole 2 November 1815 – 8 December 1864) was a largely self-taught English mathematician, philosopher and logician, most of whose short career was spent as the first professor of mathematics at Queen's College, Cork in Ireland. He worked in the fields of differential equations and algebraic logic, and is best known as the author of The Laws of Thought (1854) which contains Boolean algebra. Boolean logic is credited with laying the foundations for the information age. Boole maintained that:

>No general method for the solution of questions in the theory of probabilities can be established which does not explicitly recognise, not only the special numerical bases of the science, but also those universal laws of thought which are the basis of all reasoning, and which, whatever they may be as to their essence, are at least mathematical as to their form.

What this means is that the utter complexity of modern computing at the level of machine language is reduced to the decision between a zero or a one.
This is why we refer to computing as binary logic.
There are only two options all the time.
The basis of machine intelligence is a one-to-one match for the moral complexities of being a human being.
The simple binary by which the human heart operates is right and wrong.
Sometimes we go through phases in life where that simple dichotomy becomes blurred.
In classical spiritual stories,
the seeker is identified at a very young age as somebody seeking the highest knowledge in creation,
the knowledge of the creator himself.
The tradition of the seeker is more muted in the west than it is in the east.
Or it might be that the seeker in the west ends up in the mental fields rather than the spiritual fields.
We are taught from a very young age that the pursuit of truth is through the sciences,
through the external world,
and this is the first mistake.
The truth of our existence and what we are can only be attained through an inner search.
This results in a state of consciousness that is non-shareable through intellectual discourse.
A person of high consciousness shares knowledge by simply sitting beside you and transferring it to you through the various channels in the body and the auric field.
This is what spiritual gurus are doing with their disciples.
The reason it can't be shared intellectually is that it's attained through a series of correct Boolean decisions made in the human heart.
When we lose connection with our heart and we stop making these simple decisions between right and wrong our lives drift.
I don't like the polarity of good and evil.
It seems childish to me.
I prefer to talk about power and love.

After my military service I worked as a mercenary for a while.
They're called contractors now.
The market is huge with players that can put together huge private armies of ex-special forces from all over the world.
Much of the Iraq War under Bush,
Cheney,
and Rumsfeld was fought with private contractors from a company that at the time was called Blackwater [^16].

[^16]: The best book on Blackwater is *Blackwater: The Rise of the World's Most Powerful Mercenary Army* by Jeremy Scahill. 

Back in my day this kind of corporate organization to mercenary work didn't exist.
All you had to do was put your name out there and they would find you,
and they were almost always the CIA or an affiliate intelligence organization like MI6 or the Mossad.
It should worry everybody that military contracting has become so prolific in the twenty-first century.
War is always a messy business,
but when it's attached to a profit motive by independent corporations it becomes like private prisons.
How can we trust these most delicate of things in our societies to people who leverage their existence off of a profit motive?
It's something that a lot more people should ask themselves.
And it's another example of our slide into a power-based culture.
The fact is nation-states don't exist anymore.
They haven't for some time.
Nations themselves are nothing more than corporations now.
They are organized as corporations,
incentivized as corporations,
and desensitized to human concerns like corporations.
They exist for a single purpose:
to survive at any cost.


Remember that a corporation is an incorporation.
It means to create a body,
from the Latin corpus.
A body can't be created without something to animate the body.
In our human existence we speculate that the soul is what animates the body.
But what animates the body of a corporation?
Some form of intent must enter the body to give it motion and purpose.
I suppose we could call this a spirit of sorts.
What's the next thing that a body does?
To my sensibilities they operate within their environment.
To operate within an environment is to make decisions.
All decisions made through the human heart resolve around right and wrong.
All decisions made through a machine resolve around zero or one.
There is no moral reasoning in the machine decision process.
As a general rule nothing in human life should circumvent a human decision process.
Nothing should be left to a machine.
No decision that will affect human beings can be made outside of the human heart.
There is a moral character to all decisions which affect other human beings.
Human beings indeed form the board of directors of corporations.
The board of directors for the United States of America is represented in our federal government.
The most dramatic incorporation in the last four hundred years is the Bank of England.
It has operated with no moral reasoning.
It's simply issuing capital and collecting interest for the controllers of the bank,
as does every Central Bank in the world now.
It's impossible to be a nation-state and to trade and do business with the collective of nation-states without being apart of this banking structure now.
The case could be made that there aren't even any decisions involved anymore.
Anyone who tries to circumvent the system and do business is dealt with quite harshly.
Just ask Colonel Qaddafi.
He decided he was going to operate through his heart.
He was sitting on one of the largest natural resource bases in the world.
Libya has oil.
He created the largest freshwater aquifer in his region of the world.
He provided free post-secondary education for all citizens as part of the wealth dividend from the oil.
He was able to foresee the instability of the International Monetary Fund and its member states,
so he tried to develop an independent financial system backed on gold.
Hillary Clinton was the Secretary of State at this time.
She took her orders from the Council on Foreign Relations and other think tanks,
and she attacked Libya.
Colonel Qaddafi was brutally murdered by rebel forces that were paid by the CIA.
The ambassador to Libya was sacrificed.
He knew too much.
At that level you either play ball or you die.
Hillary Clinton glibly made jokes about it on American news shows afterward,
finding humor in the situation.


What you see if you deconstruct Libya and dozens of other examples over the last few decades is a complete absence of moral reasoning.
What happened to the right and wrong of the human heart in decision-making processes?
The corporations took them away.
These golems that run the world now,
these corporations,
whether they be former nation-states themselves,
as is the case with almost every country in the world now,
or large private-sector corporations which are adjuncts to the government,
defense contractors in the United States,
companies like Lockheed Martin,
Bechtel,
Booz Allen Hamilton,
to name just a few,
are operating on decision-making processes that are no longer filtered through human intelligence,
which includes feeling.
The systems run on process mapping.
The world is governed by *if/else/if*.

Corporations are incapable of moral reasoning.
Their reason for being brought into existence was not spiritual growth.
They are not a creation of whatever created us in the world we live in and the universe we live in.
Their mission statement from inception is profit.
Nothing in creation can deviate from its reason for being.
A shark was created to eat all the garbage in the ocean.
A tree was created to provide oxygen from a human perspective.
A corporation is created to administer fiduciary duties,
continue with survival,
and to grow,
a very important concept to understand.
It's in this growth principle that we are most deceived by corporations.
They apply a spiritual principle that is part of the creative fabric onto a non-spiritual entity,
an entity not animated by the same spirit that animates us and all the life around us.
The purpose of a corporation is to grow.
The measure of their growth is money,
and they are animated by their intent,
which is to find more money,
to create more money,
and to concentrate that money into fewer and fewer hands.
It's as though money was created to return to where it was spawned,
like a salmon making the long journey home against the current.
It's kind of magical when you think about it.
The whole world has been occulted from you.

I got tired of mercenary work,
or private contracting as the accountants in Washington call it.
I guess it's time for a lifeline update.
I went into Navy Special Warfare training in 1988.
The entire training course takes about a year and a half to finish.
I did seven years of service,
mainly as an operations officer,
then three years of *private contracting*. 
So we are up to the late nineties now.
I bought a web site called SEALstore.com from a guy called Pete *the pirate* Carolan.
He's a SEAL team guy from Vietnam.
He was one of the swimmers who would retrieve capsules from the Apollo missions when they splashed down in the ocean.
We've been friends for years.
I sold Navy Special Warfare items like T-shirts to the public,
coffee mugs,
and other things with the Navy Special Warfare logo.
It was a great little business.
This was in the very early days of web commerce.
The term *basket* had not even been developed for the Internet yet.
I put contact details up on the web site,
including my phone number.

Early on I got a call from a guy claiming to be a former commander of SEAL Team Six,
Robert Kane.
He said he needed some gear.
When he first started calling he asked for illegal things,
like quantities of firearms. 
Pete hung around my house a lot back then.
He was homeless. 
So many highly accomplished soldiers who do extended tours of duty lose themselves.
Whoever they were before they went over to whatever theater of engagement they went over to,
that guy gets shredded.
They come home and they can't find the guy again.
Nothing at home makes sense anymore.
They are master survivors,
so living rough seems normal to them.
I couldn't let that happen to Pete.
He didn't so much live with me as he had the door open for him anytime he wanted to drop by and crash on my sofa.
Pete was over one day when Kane called and I put it on speaker.
He said there's no way that guy's a team guy.
I told Pete that was my intuition too but I wanted to know more about the guy.
I turned him down and all the crazy deals he asked for,
three dozen of this kind of weapon,
this kind of explosive,
and a million and one other requests.



It's hard to paint the picture of a guy like Robert Kane.
There are no reference points.
To the best of my knowledge he hasn't been outlined in any novel or movie.
Most of the human templates are out there.
If I want to describe somebody to you I could just say,
he's like Jack Nicholson in *The Shining*.
This guy had no template.
He certainly wasn't a team guy.
He never went through Navy Special Warfare training and he sure as shit didn't command SEAL Team Six.
But he intrigued me nonetheless.
He had money.
He did buy a bunch of gear from the store,
hats,
T-shirts,
coffee mugs with the team logo on it,
stuff like that.

He was a mischief-maker.
I guess if I were to tie him to anyone in the public consciousness it would be Loki,
the Norse god of mischief.
I didn't know it at the time,
but what Kane did was set people up or do jobs with them,
depending on how the job turned out and what he thought of the people he was working with.
What do I mean by job?
It could be an operation,
which is an illegal military operation.
He could put together small teams for small jobs in foreign countries.
Sometimes the team would rip something off.
Maybe Kane had been told about a safe full of diamonds somewhere in the Far East,
stuff like that.
Where you would get that kind of information I don't know.
But Kane knew the kind of people who did.
I would later find out that he was connected in ways I couldn't have imagined.
One way of looking at guys like this is Lee Harvey Oswald.
He was a classic patsy.
They had a way to play him,
and they had a way to play Kane.
The point is,
Kane was in the game. 
The name of the game was compromise.
You don't get cut into the deeper stuff until they own you.
You don't get inside the center circle until they own you.
They own you when they control your fate.
This is important.
Make sure you get this.
It's how a lot of the world works.
These spook *rounders*,
meaning guys who are *around* the power circles
&mdash;
CIA,
FBI,
NSA,
Navy Intelligence,
Air Force Intelligence,
and all the other lettered agencies too numerous to list here
&mdash;
are the bread and butter of the intelligence world.
They never show up on payroll.
They can never really be tied to anything in a court of law.
They can never be used to prove anything about the intelligence agencies.
They're out there in the world,
looking for people like me to compromise,
a good asset for complicated work.
But they won't work with me until I'm compromised.
So we rob something,
or kill someone in a foreign country,
and a guy like Kane is casing the job the whole time to surround me with a timeline,
a motive,
and physical evidence tying me to the crime,
even though he commissioned everything, 
organized everything,
and recruited me,
then that crime is held over me to do whatever he and his intelligence controllers,
who I might never meet,
want me to do.


The *compromise* is different for everybody.
For a diplomat or banker it might be sex with a child or participation in a human sacrifice ritual.
Whatever the compromise is,
once they have it they own you.
It's like a Voodoo spell.
You're their zombie to do their bidding or you go to prison for a long time.
With friends like that, huh?
And that my friends is how the whole world works,
an endless series of leveraged compromises.
If he didn't need you after the compromise he'd flush you right away.
He generated casework for the FBI and the CIA.
He'd organize a crime and then turn his accomplices over to the authorities.
Try to think of it almost like plea bargaining before the crime happens.
The actual legal definition is entrapment,
but that doesn't matter.
The biggest lawbreakers in any system are the law enforcement agencies,
domestic or international like the CIA,
though even that's laughable these days.
Most of their work is against the American public now,
not in defense of it,
just another one of the myriad inversions that exist in this Satanic system,
inversion being the main goal of the Satanist,
an upside-down cross is a simple and direct example. 

If Kane put a job together,
or if he made a large weapons purchase on the black market,
he would often turn over the names of his accomplices to either the CIA or the FBI.
The guy that did the job would find themselves compromised.
They would either have to work for the FBI or the CIA for an indeterminate period of time doing things they would not normally do if they had free will and free conscience.
Sometimes they even went to jail.
It took me a while to put this picture together of Richard Kane.
In the beginning I was just intrigued by this guy.
How did he know so many people?
Where did all these jobs come from?
Like every team guy,
I was haunted by my past.
Pete saw too much action and he was homeless in Long Beach.
I didn't see enough action and still craved it.
Kane knew how to push my buttons.
He was a master manipulator.

He finally came up with a small job I could do.
He was looking for a fifty caliber sniper rifle.
At that time Kane lived in Chicago.
I was able to locate a fifty caliber and buy it legally and transport it to him in Chicago.
He was paying handsomely and it was worth my time and the drive from Long Beach to Chicago.
Thinking back on it now,
a lot of the incentive for staying tied into a guy like Kane was the money.
There weren't too many people in my life back then who were offering exorbitant amounts of money for two and three-week jobs.
Truth be told,
I was still an adrenaline junkie,
too.

So I packed up this thirty-year-old fifty caliber rifle with scope in a gun case,
threw it in the back of my vehicle,
and drove out to Chicago.
While I was on the interstate in Nebraska I had a cop pull in behind me and keep following me for quite some time.
There is nothing illegal about what I was doing but I felt a little self-conscious.
I pulled off into the first gas station I saw.
Unfortunately I forgot to put my blinker on.
It was all the excuse the cop needed to engage me.
He put his lights on and pulled in behind me in the gas station.
He got out of his car and walked right up to my door.
The first question he asked is,
what's in the gun case?
I told him the truth.
I got out of my car,
opened up the hatchback,
and then the gun case and let him look at the fifty caliber.
He asked why I was transporting it.
I told him I was selling it to a buyer in Chicago.
I showed him my firearms license and that was that.
He wrote me up a cautionary ticket for turning off the highway without using my blinker.


I got into Chicago and parked my vehicle.
I notified Robert that I was at his home.
He told me where to park in downtown Chicago.
He lived in a high rise condo building on the water.
I was told to leave the firearm in the vehicle and just come up and meet him first.
I did as I was told.
He was my employer at the time.
He was paying my bills to drive out there and he was giving me a very handsome profit on the sniper rifle.
He buzzed me into his building and I went up to his floor.
When he opened the door to his condo and I walked in I realized that it was a double-sized condo.
He had bought two and knocked down one of the walls.
It was beautifully furnished.
The guy lived well.
He was about thirty years old at this time.
He stood about six feet and two inches.
He was married to a Filipino woman and he had a couple of kids and she was pregnant with another one.
We went down to the underground parking in this building together and I opened up the vehicle and he looked at the rifle.
He was happy with it and we took it back up to his condominium.
He paid me the money owed and I spent a few hours talking to him.
The sniper rifle was my interview.
I passed.


I'm not quite sure if after that first sniper rifle deal I passed a test or I stepped onto a spider web,
either way I was in Kane's world and things moved fast.
He said that he wanted to work with me.
He said that he had more work than anyone could want.
It was specialized work,
the kind of work a guy like me was born to do.
I hung around in Chicago for a few days.
Once it was agreed that Kane and I would work together,
I met another guy who came over to the condo.
He took some personal details from me and went and opened up a bank account with Barclays in my name.
The next day I went down to Barclays and there was a safety deposit box in my name with seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars in it.
We then went to a computer store and bought a laptop for me.
Then we went to Kane's office.
It was across the street from the Commodities Exchange in Chicago.
Whatever Kane was he presented well.
His office was on the third floor and nestled in with a brokerage.
Everything he did had a perfect cover to it.
When I went into his office I saw that he had a Bronze Star on display and most of the gear he had bought from me online related to the SEAL teams.
There were other military medals as well. 
It was all a cover.
I knew it the moment I saw it,
but I didn't say anything,
even though it offended me this guy was pretending to be a member of Navy Special Warfare.

There was an assistant in the office with Kane.
He came in and started talking with me in the room.
He described he and his associates orchestrating the removal of sixty billion dollars from the Indonesian stock exchange. 
There was a political coup as a result,
an enemy of George Bush Senior and a difficult man to kill because of his security detail,
Abdurrahman Wahid of the *National Awakening Party*,
was taken out.
A little bit of irony in the name of the political party.
Papa Bush put them back to sleep almost immediately.
The poor bastard was only in power a year and a half,
but what he didn't get was that Suharto had fed his generals well,
and therefore the corruption was not excised with Suharto's removal from power. 
Poor Wahid tried to reform the military and they got him impeached by parliament.


Money rules the world because it controls human behavior. 
There are many ways to take people out.
One of the best is to incite the people around the target.
I didn't know what the guy was talking about,
but I knew there was the Asian Financial Crisis around that time,
but I didn't know it was a financial intelligence operation until I heard Kane's assistant come into the office and name drop Papa Bush.
One of the things you have to understand,
furthering your understanding of the true nature of money and its utility in changing the course of events,
is that intelligence assets are heavily vested in the financial community.
Why send in a team of special forces to destabilize a country when you can crash their market?
And how do you do that?
You invest a lot of money to support your guy,
and Suharto was the IMF and the CIA's guy,
and then,
when his countrymen get fed up with being fleeced through corruption and oust him from power,
as was the case with Suharto,
divest your money from the country when the new,
antagonistic leader enters the arena.
The old guy will look like the only guy who was holding things together.
You'd be amazed what happens when a mid-size economy like Indonesia loses fifty or sixty billion of market capital in seventy-two hours.

So there I was,
the owner of a website that sold Navy SEAL insignia stuff,
in the office of a guy to who I just sold a fifty caliber sniper rifle,
listening to his assistant tell me about the takedown of Indonesia while hinting at connections to George Bush Senior.
One of the things you have to understand,
is that George Bush Senior ran America from 1988 until Trump got into office.
He ran Clinton and he ran Obama.
His kid was run as well,
and Cheney and Rumsfeld were there for good measure.
There is no overstating the power that George Bush Senior had in the world.
He is the clearest example of a behind the curtain and on stage power at the same time.
It usually doesn't happen that way.
Usually, the guy on the stage has hidden handlers,
people in committees behind him dictating his every move or her every move,
and keep in mind I'm not just talking about the United States here;
I'm talking about the whole world pretty much.
Papa Bush was the exception.
But what do you expect,
really?
He was the Director of the CIA.
That's the *behind the curtain* power.
They've been a nearly completely rogue and unaccountable agency since their birth out of the OSS (Office of Strategic Services).
There isn't a thing that I'll mention in this book that the CIA is not involved in
&mdash;
occult rituals,
extraterrestrials,
child trafficking
&mdash;
both as a facilitator and a protection service for those *compromised* people on their web.
It's a shit show.


After this ever so brief parlay in Kane's office,
we decided to go and get some lunch.
It turns out that the guy wasn't Kane's assistant.
He was a broker who worked at the office.
The way he originally came into the office and supplicated himself to Kane I assumed he was an assistant.
We went to a nice steak house.
They weren't going to let me pass the front door because I was in workout clothes.
When the broker walked in behind me the waiter got me a dinner jacket and told us to wait at the bar.
We had a bottle of wine at the bar while we were waiting for a table to clear by the fireplace.
The restaurant wanted me out of sight because I was wearing a dinner jacket over a tracksuit.
We finally got seated and we all ordered the same thing.
It was off the menu.
Steaks wrapped in bacon with a little bit of seafood.
Kane was trying to facilitate a conversation between myself and the broker.
I didn't know how to relate to this guy.
He came from a world I didn't understand.
He was moneyed,
suave,
and connected.


After lunch,
we went back to Kane's condo.
We stayed up all night having drinks and talking.
Kane explained to me how the world works from his perspective.
There was no such thing as countries anymore they were all just corporations.
War was another extension of business.
There was no room for sentiment.
This was the way the world worked and nothing would ever change it.
It was like listening to a guy talk out loud explaining how he could get rich with a lemonade stand in hell.
Talk about acclimatizing yourself to any environment.
Kane had no moral compass.
He was like a shark.
He just constantly moved,
looking for things to consume.
Anything that he wanted to consume was something that would make him a lot of money without any work,
and in many instances it was stealing the work of somebody else.
None of it was illegal.
All of it was immoral.
I felt like a new soul coming to the planet fully formed as an adult getting a briefing from a minion of Satan himself.


What astounded me most about Kane's dissertation on the world as he knew it was how the winners and losers of every conflict were selected before the conflict.
He was postulating a world in which nothing was random.
It was a lot to take in.
I'd been drinking all afternoon,
all evening,
and all night.
I no longer lived the Mormon code at that point in my life,
but I was nowhere near what you would call a heavy drinker.
I sat in that condo until the sun came up and listened to Kane's intoxicating perspective on the world,
a world where anything was possible for those who knew how it worked,
and almost nothing but a meager list of goals was possible for anyone who didn't know how the world worked.
He told me about a seven-foot-tall extraterrestrial he'd seen in a laboratory somewhere.
I told him I didn't know what he was talking about.
He moved on to other stuff.
I was way too green back then to make the extraterrestrial connection.
I hadn't put it all together yet.
The extraterrestrial connection would come later in my life.
But the broker knew what was what.
He knew what ran the world.
He told me straight up in that condominium in Chicago and I was too green to hear it.


What was established that night was a working relationship.
Along with the laptop computer that had been bought for me at Circuit City came a black box that was used for scrambling any communication between us.
The car I had driven down in was a rental.
I left it in Chicago with the rental company and Kane took me to the airport the next day and paid cash for a ticket back home to Long Beach.


When I got back to Long Beach I was contacted very quickly afterward by Kane.
He wanted me to go out to Nevada and meet a guy named Duke Piper to help him in the purchase of some land.
It turns out the land was for a range so a team could practice.
I assumed at that point that I was part of a team.
It's strange how that was never made clear to me in the condo in Chicago.
What I learned moving around in these circles was that contract was something else other than a signature on a piece of paper.
They seem to imply consent at certain points of negotiation whether you realized it or not.
We didn't end up purchasing the land in Nevada.
I flew back home to Long Beach.
The next I heard from Kane he wanted me to go to the Philippines with him on an operation.
He had put a team together.
He told me the team would be leaving by private charter plane in a week.
He also mentioned that he had to briefly go over to Italy to be knighted by the Pope in the Knights of Malta.
Now, normally when somebody says something like that out loud you might think they're crazy.
Especially after you've seen how they live and how they make their money,
and especially after you've heard their worldview,
which is a kind of predatory economics without a level playing field,
but sure enough I later saw the pin.
Kane was a Knight of Malta.
What's more,
he was knighted by the Pope himself.
There's a ceremonial sword for it.
You get tapped on both shoulders.
It all sounds cheesy but it goes on.
In these controller circles,
these circles of people who run the world,
these kinds of titles are a really big deal.
At the time of the Philippines operation I couldn't go.
I was newly married and my wife was pregnant with my son.
She didn't want me to go.
Women always have better instincts than men.
I told Kane I couldn't go and I told him why.
He kept asking me for things while I was in the United States.
He needed gear for the mission:
boots,
combat pants,
non-artillery,
non-armament gear.
I tried to help him but it turned out that it was impossible to mail that stuff to the Philippines.
I ended up going over to the Philippines myself after a few arguments with my then-wife.
I took a duffel bag full of all of the gear that Kane had requested.
It was in the Philippines that he showed me the pin from the Pope,
the Knight of Malta pin.



So I got over to the Philippines and met Kane at his hotel suite.
He was in the presidential suite of a five-star hotel.
His wife was there and his kids.
He never left the hotel room.
His wife left every day to go shopping and to visit people,
and her family came to the presidential suite almost daily to visit her.
So there I was in this presidential suite in the Philippines trying to put together some kind of a plan based on a directive I had not yet been given.
As I watched Kane on the satellite phone,
I realized that he was an order taker not an order giver.
He kept saying *yes senator*.
I later realized he was talking to John McCain.


Kane would get nervous when McCain called.
And McCain called almost every night.
He would pace back and forth with a satellite phone to his ear,
reassuring the senator back in Arizona that this or that had already been taken care of and this or that was being taken care of,
and generally that we were on top of everything.
There was another guy on the team that I enjoyed.
His name was David.
He was an ex British SAS.
I have the highest respect for these soldiers.
They're training and their dedication is commensurate with Navy Special Warfare.
Never pick a fight with an SAS man.
It was nice to have another soldier to talk with.
Once you learn how to be a soldier there's a commonality to it that's universal.
There was a desk set up in a quiet part of the presidential suite.
A phone and a chair were put at the desk.
David and I took turns fielding calls that came into that number.
It also had some gear hooked up to it to scramble communications for anyone who might be listening who was not supposed to be.
David did most of the work on the phone,
and he told me that every other day a guy named George would call,
and recognizing the voice,
David told me it was George Bush.


Whatever was going on in that hotel suite,
very powerful figures all over the world were connected to Robert Kane.
A little while into the stay in the Philippines,
Kane showed me a fax that had come in from the Vatican.
They wanted to set up an orphanage.
Kane explained to me what that meant.
The higher-ups in the world didn't find children to rape,
ritually murder,
and sacrifice,
they took them from their orphanages.
They set up their orphanages to supply their networks with children for whatever nefarious ends the clients wanted the children.


I know this is stomach-turning.
I know this is going to be upsetting to many Catholics.
I'm not trying to offend anybody.
If it evens it out a little bit,
I will tell you,
from my experience,
every major religion in the world is involved in child trafficking,
including my birth religion of Mormonism.
What I want to take a moment to point out here is that everything I am telling you is based on first-hand experience.
I have not researched these things.
I have experienced them.
I stood in that hotel room for hours arguing with Kane.
David and I were adamant.
We were shooters.
We were muscle.
We were tacticians for small operations in a foreign country.
We were not procurers of children,
and we didn't set up orphanages to snuff the lives of children for the elite and depraved.
All the while this is going on there are consistently about eight people in the hotel suite.
Most of them I didn't talk to.
They weren't soldiers.
They were spooks.
I fucking hate spooks.
Most soldiers do.
They're despicable little weasels for the most part.
You can believe your bullshit movies about Jason Bourne if you want,
but to me, the CIA means a fat and incapable pedophile with the power of a pencil.
They're fucking disgusting.


Nobody knew what was going on in that hotel room in the Philippines.
We were waiting for some kind of directive but it didn't seem to come.
After my *outburst*
&mdash;
yes,
that's how they saw it,
an outburst
&mdash;
about the orphanage fax from the Vatican,
I was relegated to my room.
I spent most of my time working on my website for the SEAL gear.
A few of the operators would come and talk to me.
David the SAS Soldier came and spoke to me.
Another guy by the name of Bob Hoffman would come and talk to me.
Hoffman gave me a sick feeling.
He didn't identify himself.
Spooks are like that.
Soldiers tell you who they are right away.
Spooks just leave you in the dark.
So I sat in the hotel room and filled orders from my website and made money from the Philippines.


When Kane found out what I was doing,
he had the password to the Internet changed.
At that time,
you had to pay for the Internet by the minute.
It wasn't like today.
This was 1999.
The internet was still a novel thing.
I started to get bored,
so one night I went down to the bar by myself to have a few drinks.
It turns out that Hoffman had been reporting to somebody we didn't know in our group.
It was another American who had come over to the Philippines but had not announced himself formally in the presidential suite.
He was hanging out in the shadows,
and Hoffman was reporting to him.
So when I found myself at the bar alone,
this fellow slid in beside me and introduced himself.
He told me he was with the CIA,
which I found commendable,
given that most of them never tell you,
and he told me that Hoffman had reported to him that I was the most approachable of the group.
I had no idea what this was about.
I thought the meeting in the condominium in Chicago with Kane and the broker was the interview.
I thought I got the job.
It turns out it was just the interview to get a shot at the interview.
That thing happening at the bar that night,
that was the interview.
It's amazing how many layers these people put around things.
Just imagine how difficult any of this would be to explain in a court of law.
That's why they do it the way they do it.


Now this next part of my story is going to sound very strange.
I have no recourse but to tell you the whole truth at this point.
Now is the time to tell my story.
There will be people who believe me because they have experienced similar.
There will be people who are open to believing me but not completely committed,
and there will be those who will call me crazy.
When this CIA guy sat down beside me,
I started to hear a voice at the back of my left ear,
as though it was right inside my head.
It was answering all of my questions before I even verbalized them.
In my head I had a vision of a pit and people walking around the pit.
Some people went into the pit.
I decided to go into the pit.
It was very dark inside the pit.
There was the faintest glow of light.
I could see others around me.
I asked somebody how to get out.
They said,
look up.
I looked up,
and I saw a little pinpoint of light.
The voice then said, Concentrate all your attention on the light.
I did as I was told and I was pulled out of the pit.
To this day that meeting in the bar remains one of the most extraordinary experiences of my life.
I guess the lesson here is that you find unclaimed parts of yourself by going out and living.
That experience inside my head with what I can only call my spirit was to let me know that I was going into an area of darkness I might not be able to get out of.
The whole time this voice was going in my head,
I was maintaining a conversation with the CIA guy at the bar.
He kept buying drinks.
When he wasn't looking,
I'd would pour mine into a cactus beside me.
I didn't want to get drunk.
I didn't even want to be drinking with this guy.


The voice in my head kept telling me how the world operated.
I was shown a room with a very large table in it and several hundred people.
I asked inside my head,
What is this?
The voice said,
These are the people who run the world,
the Committee of Three Hundred.
I looked around the room and I noticed two figures in the room and I said,
Those two aren't human.
The voice said,
No they're not.
I asked,
Where does the power come from?
Where do these people get their power?
The voice said,
They get it from money.
The intentional energy that everybody puts into money gets fed up to the people with the most money.
The money is a harvesting system.
It harvests anticipation,
intentionality,
and all of the power of human consciousness.
I asked where all this came from.
The voice told me that it came from extraterrestrials.
I asked,
What are they going to do with all of this power?
The voice said,
They're going to seek physical immortality and they're going to go to other worlds to conquer them and rule them the way this world is ruled.
Now remember,
this is going on in my head the whole time I'm at the bar having an actual conversation with the CIA guy.
To this day I don't know what happened.
I don't think it was any voice to skull technology.
My best guess is that it was the expression of my spirit.
However,
there was the CIA guy,
and a lot of the tip-tier intelligence community is rooted in the occult.


Why do you think a guy like Robert Kane was going to the Vatican to be knighted by the Pope?
In this experience,
and I don't have another word for it,
because if I were to call it a vision it would take on religious connotations and there was nothing religious about this experience,
I asked the voice in my head,
Who runs the whole show?
Above the table where the world's most powerful people had gathered,
I saw beings come in and out of phase.
They looked human but they were a little bit off.
If you passed them on the street you would think they were human.
If you were in a room with them and interacted with them or had the opportunity to stare right at them for ten minutes or so,
your intuition would tell you there's something off about them but you would not be able to put your finger on it.
They wore black hats and black suits.
I didn't know at the time whether or not these were the men in black that were spoken about in the extraterrestrial world.
They certainly did match the description.
So all of this is going down at the end of the second millennium,
in 1999 in a five-star hotel in the Philippines.
You have to understand,
except for the experience during hell week where I thought I was talking to extraterrestrials in a triangular craft out on my raft in the ocean at night,
I wasn't an extraterrestrial guy.
I didn't read books about extraterrestrials.
I didn't ask questions about extraterrestrials.
I had no curiosity about them whatsoever.
It's not that I disbelieved,
it just never even entered into my radar as I had gone about my life that far.
So to have this explanation of extraterrestrial control of the world given to me at a bar in the Philippines in a five-star hotel was freaky to say the least.



It was the beginning of the extraterrestrial rabbit hole for me.
It would culminate in an invitation from Billy Meier to go and visit him in Switzerland at the compound several years later,
but I don't want to get ahead of my story.
When I went back to the hotel room the rest of the crew grilled me about what I and the CIA guy spoke about,
even Robert Kane.
Everybody seemed terrified of this guy.
He was like the Tony Soprano of this group.
He was the boss.
The grilling went on for about three hours.
I told them everything they asked me about that happened in the actual physical conversation between myself and the CIA guy,
but I kept the interior dialogue to myself.
Quite frankly,
I wasn't even sure if I was sane at that point.
With my military background,
my thinking was leaning toward the idea that I got dosed with some kind of drug.
I didn't have a clue what was going on.
I needed some time to digest it all.


Robert Kane decided that I was to be terminated.
Both myself and David,
the SAS Soldier,
were fired on the spot.
We were each given one thousand five hundred dollars spending money,
and we had to immediately give back what we had left.
We were promised two hundred and fifty dollars a day while we were there plus all expenses and they reneged on that.
We were put into a car,
driven to the airport,
and walked to the gate,
then Robert Kane and Bob Hoffman left.
But only after they were sure we were through customs and at the gate for the airplane.
Whatever happened,
I failed the interview.

It was a long flight back from the Philippines.
I forget what time I left Manila.
I got into California the next day at ten at night.
The next morning at six o'clock.
I was arrested at my own home for allegedly stealing the computer that Robert Kane had bought for me at Circuit City in Chicago.
This is what I was trying to explain earlier in this chapter,
how these guys operate.
Everything is done by leverage.
They don't take a step forward unless they have you leveraged.
It's like a gang initiation.
In a lot of the LA gangs you have to kill somebody in a rival gang to make your bones.
There's not a whole lot of difference between a street gang and the CIA and how it operates.
It's a testament to my character and the character of Dave the SAS man that we both failed.
Some tests you just don't want to pass.
I was able to get the computer theft dismissed within a week.


The mother of my five and a half-month-old son took off shortly after I returned from the Philippines.
She had been seeing another guy while I was away.
I was left with this newborn baby boy,
my first child and I was nearly forty years old.
I wanted to get back out in the game,
but I couldn't.
I looked at this little boy who needed me,
his father,
and I was done.
The game was over for me. 

The one small act of retribution I allowed myself was adding Robert Kane's name to the *Wall of Shame*.
It was a website where team guys outed people pretending to be SEALs.
Kane's name was up for only a week or so before I received a call from the CIA to take his name down.
I hate spooks.
Here's the takeaway,
you always get a choice,
a simple Boolean choice,
a zero or a one in computing,
a yes or a no is moral reasoning.
David and I said no to Richard Kane's shit show.
