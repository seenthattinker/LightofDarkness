Palo Mayombe
===================


My adventures with the Plejeran crew in Switzerland went on for some years.
I studied and grappled with the material.
I knew it to be true in the sense that Billy was a contactee,
but I knew it wasn't the final answer to what was going on on this planet.
Not by a long shot.
I had many experiences with Plejarens.
Once you hook up with them,
especially the ones around Billy Meier,
they pop up from time to time.
I must say at this point,
I do not believe they are real Plejarens,
or any benign extraterrestrial group positively aligned with human growth,
but rather an impostor group.
There was also a cult-like atmosphere around the Switzerland experience. 
People had rote answers to questions,
the way cult members do.
I didn't see a lot of creative thinking or ingenuity.
The whole thing hinged upon Billy's contacts,
his notes,
and his dissertations.


There were times I would be driving down the highway on the California coast and I would look in my rearview mirror and there would be a spaceship trailing me.
By this time,
which was around 2011,
my ability to see things with my mind's eye,
and my sense of understanding about the unseen things,
was razor-sharp.
The trip to Switzerland,
and the studying of the Plejeran material,
only made me more curious about what was going on in this world.


I was also going through a very difficult divorce at this time with my son's mother,
who had come back into our lives and was creating a lot of disturbance for myself and my son Reis.
She had returned several years after abandoning Reis and me.
My access to my son was through her.
I was being squeezed for more and more money.
I was always in court.
It was one of the worst periods of my life.
I had gone back to university in those years and studied law.
It was my brother's suggestion.
I did it at night school.
I continued with the boat cleaning business full-time.
I've always been a high-performance person.
I never took the bar exam,
but I did take the full law course load,
and I did pass.
I did this after my son was born.
It's a weird thing about me.
I study things but I don't necessarily get the accreditation.
It's as though some part of me knows that accreditation is a bunch of bullshit.
I was representing myself in the proceedings in court.
The judge hated me for it.
They always hate it when competent litigators represent themselves.



At that time I had extended my boat washing business into deck reconstruction as well.
Anything that involved diving I loved,
that sweet water around me all day,
its insulating protection,
the silence and calm of the sea close to shore.
It's my comfort zone,
shown to me by my father when I was a kid in his apartment complex pool with an old mask and oxygen tank.
So building decks that went far out into the water for larger boats was something I got into.
There's always a way to make a living if you have a little bit of creativity and a work ethic.
Don't let anybody tell you any different.


I had hired a Latino guy named Luis to help me.
He was an efficient carpenter.
I don't know what he saw in me,
but one day he said,
Hey man,
I think somebody's fucking with you.
I replied sarcastically,
What gives you that impression?
The fact that I'm in court at least once a week.
No,
He said.
I mean in a different way.
I mean I think somebody's working magic on you.
You should come and see my godfather.
I had no idea what he meant by  *godfather*.
He explained that he sometimes used the services of a Tata in the Palo Mayombe religion.
I'd never heard of it.
I knew about Santeria but I had never heard of Palo Mayombe.
We talked about it a little bit while we were working on the deck,
and I agreed to take a drive into Los Angeles and meet with his godfather.
I had nothing to lose,
and I was more than a little bit curious.


We went to see the godfather that night after working late on a deck,
which was late,
around nine-thirty PM.
We got in my truck and drove to Compton,
a place called The Magical Cave.
My friend,
Luis,
went in alone to see if it was okay to bring me in.
All I could see was darkness.
There was plate glass in front of the place,
and it was tinted so dark that you couldn't see inside.
It looked like a television screen turned off.
The door pulled open,
and Luis stuck his head out and gestured for me to come in.
I told Reis to stay in the truck.
He was eleven years old at the time.
I had him that day.
It was my visitation day.
He had been at the deck with me and Luis all day,
too.
He fetched tools and nails,
stuff like that.
I gave him a decent *worked for* allowance.
I went to the door of The Magical Cave and poked my head in to get a feel for the place.
It was dark inside,
lit only by candles.
I couldn't see much because my eyes had no adjusted from the bright street lights.
I went back to the truck and told Reis to lock the doors and just stay in the truck and have a nap.




I went back through the door and met Luis.
He told me to sit down and wait for the godfather,
and he told me that when the godfather came to be quiet,
not to say anything.
All I was supposed to do was hand him the picture of my ex-wife.
I did what I was told.
The godfather,
a Latino guy named Bobby in his mid-to-late forties,
came out and introduced himself.
He looked at me studiously and asked,
Are you in law enforcement?
I gave him a brief background.
told him I was a Navy SEAL.
He said he could see it all over me.
I handed him the picture of my ex-wife and he said,
She wants you dead.
She wants all of the assets.
She hired someone to do magic on you.
Do you know a woman with dark curly black hair?
I didn't and told him so.



The next thing the godfather did was disappear into another room.
I later learned that this was the munanso.
I think he had to ask for permission to bring me in.
When he came back out he asked me to follow him into the munanso.
This is the room that holds the ngangas,
which are the cauldrons
&mdash;
the steel pots
&mdash;
the spirits are trapped within.
I did as I was instructed,
but,
before I went into the munanso,
I told Luis to keep an eye on the outside to make sure Reis was okay in the truck.


Bobby told me to keep my head bent down and my eyes closed.
I was taken into the munanso like a child,
eyes closed,
held by the arm.
When we got inside,
Bobby told me to get down on my knees.
I thought about it for a half-second,
long enough to consider it but not long enough to appear hesitant.
The request ran through my self-defense instincts.
It was a very vulnerable position to be on your knees.
I did it.
I got down on my knees.
For a moment I thought I was going to be beheaded.
I was cracking my eyes open a little bit here and there,
and I could see these pots and candles and what I thought was red wax from a candle but later learned was blood.


I'd never been in a room in which blood sacrifices were made.
There was a palpable energy and presence in the room.
I was told to just breathe and relax.
I slipped into a meditative state and immediately went to another dimension.
I could see with my inner vision a spirit above each of the pots.
The spirits were egg-shaped.
They were not human spirits.
They were elemental spirits.
Each one was a different color.
One was red.
One was green.
One was purple,
and so forth.
I knew immediately that these spirits could see right through me.
It was impossible to lie.
There was a question that issued forward from the spirits:
what are you here for?
I said nothing.
I thought nothing.
I just stared at them through my mind's eye and they stared back at me.
There was no negativity there.
The space or realm of these elemental spirits was neutral.
It was very dark.
A dim light came off of each of the spirits in the color it represented.
But there was no sense of negativity.
There was no overwhelming sense of positivity.
It was like a neutral zone.
There was a very strange peace in the place.



I interpreted the peace as love.
I felt like a newborn baby swaddled in a wool blanket.
It was a beautiful experience.
I didn't know that darkness had such beauty.
It had its own light.
There was a light to the darkness.
I immediately fell in love with it and all of the spirits ran through me like a wind,
a beautiful cool breeze.
The godfather stood me up.
My eyes were still closed.
He walked me into the other room.
The godfather told me he had never done that before,
never taken someone who had just walked into his shop into the munanso before.
He told me it never happens.
Only initiates can go into the munanso.
I don't know what he saw in me when I walked through his door that made him think I was the first person ever that he could take into the munanso absent an initiation in Palo Mayombe.
I asked the godfather how many spirits were in the room.
I told him I saw twelve or thirteen.
He almost fell off his chair.
He was absolutely and utterly stunned.
Keep in mind,
at this point in my life, I hadn't had any measuring stick for my perception.
I had been seeing things around me since I was a kid and I had my first near-death experience,
but I had no experience with any formal,
initiatic path that commiserated with the other side.
Normally these skills are acquired through practice and initiation.
Apparently, I always had them and didn't even know it.



Bobby knew at that moment that I would be a member of his house.
He fast-tracked me.
I was initiated immediately.
I didn't know it at the time,
but there was a lot of work to be done in these houses.
All kinds of people came to these *Tatas* and their associates,
of which I was one,
for advice and counsel and very often for retribution.
I was immediately given a nganga,
then another,
then another,
and then I was given my steel pot.
The steel pot contained the spirit of a Mason who had died.
His ashes were in the pot.
Almost any Spirit could be trapped in a pot or conjured through a pot.
What went into the pots that summoned the nature spirits would be different than what it went into a pot that summoned a dead human being like the Mason.
My godfather told me that I was assigned the Mason because he didn't like women when he was alive and my problems centered around women.

So I got initiated right there and then.
After that, I went home.
Reis was staying with me that night,
so I put him to bed and then a little while later I went to bed,
mulling over what I had experienced that evening.
Two days later,
when I was alone in my apartment,
taking a shower,
Zarabanda came into my home and I had a conversation with him while I was in the shower.
I know this sounds strange,
but this happens once you've been initiated on these paths.
The spirits begin to communicate with you in a very direct way,
or at least they did with me.
The experience takes place entirely within your consciousness,
but your consciousness begins to take on characteristics of physical reality.
That's how present the spirits are when you're talking to them.
The conversation is completely lucid,
like you're talking to a friend.
The responses from the spirit are not manufactured by your unconscious.
You are talking to an individuated being in a non-physical form.
I drove over to my godfather's shop that day and told him what happened with the spirit while I was in the shower.
I hadn't studied the Palo pantheon and had no idea what I was saying when I named Zarabanda.
Bobby was shocked.
My godfather had big plans for me.
I was a cash cow for him.



The initiation process is very physical.
Your blood goes into the pot and mixes with the dirt in the pot.
And then you take some of the dirt out of the pot and rub it into the wound.
The cut is made right where the thumb and the forefinger have their joint.
One small cut on the top and one small cut on the inside and then the blood is squeezed into the pot.
This joins you with the spirit in the pot.
Some rules went with the initiation as well.
We were committed to following the laws of god.
We were committed to never going against our godfather.
The secrets of Palo Mayombe can never be revealed to non-initiates.
I was instructed to always work with the spirits respectfully.
All of these things were put forward as postulates and the initiate had to agree and affirm that they would follow the rules.
The entire experience was very loving.
It had the same peace as being in the spirit dimension the first time I went into the munanso.


It's difficult to explain,
but I'll try.
The dark side,
which we can put entirely under the umbrella of the Satanic-Luciferian path,
has the ability to manufacture something that feels like love.
All of these entities exist within dark matter.
In Palo Mayombe we call this po.
In Palo Mayombe we refer to the po as a feminine space.
It's also a neutral space.
This means it's not charged positively or negatively at an emotional level.
It's almost like you're sitting in the dead center of all emotional experience and it's perfectly balanced out and the sum of all emotions is encapsulated in that dark matter,
that dark space,
the po.
It's one of the great secrets of the left-hand path
&mdash;
the darkness is perfect peace.
You are at peace.
Things can be called from the dark matter to manifestation through divine love.
The divine love attracts the matter and it's formed into whatever is requested.
And that's how the darkness works.
When you're in the dark space,
everything backs off and just leaves you be.
And the sense of tranquility and peace is unbelievable.
It's one of the most beautiful things I've ever experienced.
There is no beauty like it on earth.
It's as though you're standing in front of god.
But it's the dark god.
It is the god of the darkness.


There are,
in fact,
two gods,
one of the light and one of the dark.
The dark is feminine.
The light is masculine.
The dark god is feminine.
The light god is masculine.
This is how the dual worlds work.
Within the world of the dark matter, some practitioners try to hide in the dark matter and do very negative things.
They try to create their worlds in there and hide in the cracks of the darkness.
This is how dark magic is done.
It's a violation of the rules of both the light and the dark.
It's an abomination.
When trying to understand the light and the dark and why the creator would make both sides and create a god at the top of each side,
try to see it through the following analogy.
If we look at the insect world,
human beings are uniformly revolted by a cockroach,
and,
generally speaking,
human beings are delighted with a butterfly.
Both are created by the natural process to balance out the energies in the dual worlds and to serve certain functions.
The butterfly indeed has no real natural function except for a little bit of pollination,
but their workload is about one percent of what the bees do.
The cockroach, on the other hand, is a tireless worker for the natural system,
cleaning up messes left by death and other things that need to be cleaned up in nature.
They go where they can eat things,
and they clean up things that would otherwise stay around and cause disease or other problems for the natural system.
They're one of the hardest working things in the natural system,
but,
to a human being,
a cockroach should be stepped on and a butterfly should be celebrated.
Palo Mayombe taught me to see the beauty in everything.


With my initiation completed,
I began my apprenticeship under my godfather,
Bobby.
I made my munanso in my garage.
The spirits need to be put in a safe place nobody will go.
The first thing I was taught was how to read pictures,
more specifically,
how to look at a picture of someone given by a client and read what was going on in the picture and get a psychic imprint of the person in the picture.
Then I was taught how to remote view.
Then I was taught how to speak with the spirits.
Most of the stuff my godfather was teaching me I already knew,
but I had to go through the motions.
I was taught how to work with the spirits and how to get things done.
I was taught how to do magic.
I was taught how to mix natural things to produce an effect.
This is the magic of the elements,
the basis of so many magical systems in the world.
I was taught how to clean people.
I was taught how to do animal sacrifice correctly,
and what the blood symbolized,
what it meant on the other side.
I got to see it with my own eyes.
I was taught how to exorcise people,
how to help them with ailments,
and how to help them with relationship problems.


As my apprenticeship progressed,
I began to get my clients assigned to me by my godfather.
At this point, it worked kind of like Amway.
I would keep a little bit of the commission for the spiritual work but the bulk of it would go to my godfather.
As my involvement in Palo Mayombe continued,
I began to notice something very interesting
&mdash;
our magic didn't work on people who called on the name of Jesus Christ.
I found this very curious.
I could work with all of the spirits.
There was no limitation on me.
My godfather used me a lot.
I was assigned to a lot of clients.
Over time I began to notice that my godfather had a fear I would grow stronger than him on the path.
I figured out after some time that not only was my blood in the pots but so was my godfather's.
This was a violation of the rules.
Each initiate was supposed to be given their spirit pots and be unmolested by any other practitioner of Palo Mayombe.
The individual relationship with the spirits was sacrosanct to Palo Mayombe.
My godfather was watching me through my pots.
This meant that I was a slave to my godfather.
He owned me through the pots.
His dirt was mixed with my dirt.
His blood was mixed with my blood.
He controlled me through my spirits.
He didn't tell me this upfront.
It was a great deception and a violation of the rules of Palo Mayombe,
but,
it wasn't that surprising when I figured it out.
The key thing to know here is that he was in the wrong by the rules of Palo Mayombe,
and wrong from the perspective of the spirits themselves.
His duplicity at the inception of my sojourn through Palo Mayombe ultimately became his undoing.


Alongside this growing awareness of my godfather's duplicity in his introducing me to Palo Mayombe,
was my growing curiosity as to why none of our magic would work on somebody who called on Jesus Christ.
I consulted the pots.
What the pots told me was that when a person went to Jesus Christ they were already done in and so the spirits of Palo Mayombe didn't have to do anything.
Now think about that very hard.
I'm not trying to offend anyone who has been raised in a belief in Jesus Christ.
I'm sharing direct intelligence from the spiritual world about what Jesus Christ and the teachings and the spiritual milieu on the other side have come to represent.
People who go to Jesus Christ and into the church system get done in the same way they would get done in if they were dealt with by the spirits in Palo Mayombe.
Think of it this way.
It was like getting a contract to pave a driveway,
and when you get to the house the driveway is already paved so there's no work to be done.
I realize what I am saying might be profoundly offensive to a lot of Christians.
I'll give you one example in contemporary news.
John of God in Brazil was reputed to be a Christian healer.
I knew way before the news came out about him running a child trafficking ring and throwing teenage girls into enslavement to produce babies to sell on the open market that he was a practitioner of the dark side.
I knew the grouping of spirits he was working with on the Christian side and they are extremely malignant.
Any practitioner of Palo Mayombe or Santeria or any of the other fourth-dimensional spiritual arts could have told you this way before the newspapers did.



The blood rituals are about sidestepping the law of cause and effect.
At least that is what we were taught in the school.
The blood is an energy on the other side.
If you want to kill someone in the world,
and you have the proper connections,
you can put out a contract on their life.
It's the same thing with blood magic,
except the currency is blood instead of money,
and the assassin is on the other side.
The spiritually unprotected will have grave misfortune visit them.
A blood offering is made to commence the work,
kind of like a down payment,
some up front,
and the balance of the blood is promised on the completion of the task.
I fully realize how irrational this sounds to the twenty-first century,
educated,
first world person,
but remember what I told you in The Worshipful Fuellers chapters
&mdash;
there are many layers of literal and figurative expression to the Moloch ritual.
Dropping your kids off at Oxford University murders the imagination.
Magic is one hundred percent real.
However,
it's very difficult to control these forces.
It's also extremely difficult to control the force of cause and effect.
The force of cause and effect is administered from a dimension above the fourth dimension,
so you may be able to  delay the effect for your entire lifetime,
but what the practitioners of these fourth-dimensional arts don't understand is that it's attached to you and it will work out in another life.


It's not just the blood.
It's what the blood contains.
Human blood has a little aspect of the human spirit in it.
It's a super fine electrical charge but on the other side it's amplified.
The spirits also feed on the energy of the death,
the pain and suffering of the animal.
The actual soul of the sacrificed thing,
and some of the darker houses of Palo Mayombe do indeed sacrifice human beings,
goes on to where it would go after any normal death.
The soul of the individual thing sacrificed,
whether chicken or what-have-you,
is unmolested by the sacrifice.
The energy created by the death and the energy in the blood is what is consumed.
This is why in the Satanic rituals that sacrifice human beings there is so much pain and torture before death.
That is what is consumed.
There are entities that live in the fourth dimension that feed off of negative human emotions even without a sacrifice.
In Palo Mayombe we are dealing with very specific elemental spirits and very specific dead human beings.
In the human sacrifices in which adrenochrome is extracted, 
the suffering enriches the drug. 
This is consumed by living human beings who practice the sacrifice.
It's also sold as a narcotic. 



For the spirits involved in Palo Mayombe rituals,
the bloodletting is one component of the energies that are consumable.
Because of what these spirits are doing,
they're running short on energy,
and they are in a negative relationship as much as a practitioner of Palo Mayombe.
It's a two-way street.
That's why the bond between the initiates and the spirits is so strong.
Every spirit in the pantheistic hierarchy of Palo Mayombe has a name and a number.
There is a script used by Tatas to direct the spirits.
It can be written in chalk on the floor or wall of the munanso.
The offerings are made on the altar,
and the practitioner also speaks directly with the spirits after the sacrificial offering.
That's how it all works.


The devil is real.
It's an entity that is a part of this fourth-dimensional reality.
I summoned him once.
It was near the end of my tenure in Palo Mayombe,
and right around the time my godfather was revealed as being disingenuous in my initiation and practice.
The devil is a vile entity who is almost impossible to entertain.
The negative vibration is so intense my Tata vomited.
Let's just say he is aptly referred to as the *unclean* one,
but he is in no way,
shape,
or form the all-powerful entity the religions make him out to be.


When you're involved in Palo Mayombe you're part of a house.
The house is the group of initiates who are under one godfather.
As part of the oath of Palo Mayombe,
you're not allowed to go against your house.
The problem with my sojourn in Palo Mayombe is my godfather initiated a lot of very nefarious people.
It wasn't long before my house was involved in the drug trade.
One of the things that an advanced practitioner of Palo Mayombe can do is remote view.
If you're unfamiliar with what remote viewing is,
the term was coined by the US Military and they jokingly covered it in a movie called The Men Who Stare at Goats.
I can assure you that remote viewing is completely real.
All major militaReis in the world use it now.
It's part of the psychic or occult division of any intelligence or military operation.
A remote viewer is like a crow's eye.
They can see things in other parts of the world through their mind's eye,
and give details to troops,
and they can communicate with troops on the ground if they are a powerful enough remote communicator.
This is one of the oldest and one of the most secret aspects of military engagement.
My godfather decided we were going to get into remote viewing to ensure that drug shipments coming in from Mexico and Colombia hit the beach in California without being molested by the authorities.
Given my background as a Navy SEAL, I could not take part in this.
I told my godfather this and he understood.
He told me to just sit it out and not to give any information on the house,
essentially not betray the house.


There was a shipment coming in one Saturday night. 
My godfather remote viewed it before the event and told the boat operators in our Palo Mayombe house to change the schedule.
The Colombians who were coming in on a pontoon boat were difficult to contact.
They were way out at sea.
The subordinate in the Palo Mayombe house decided not to listen to the godfather and he went out into the California sea for the handoff.
His choice was between disobeying his godfather in Palo Mayombe or not fulfilling his obligation to a Colombian cartel.
Talk about a rock and a hard spot.
My godfather was completely accurate.
There was too much surveillance that night and they all got caught.
In attempting to flee,
a Coast Guard officer was killed.
That escalated the investigation big time.
All of a sudden the FBI got involved and everybody in my Palo Mayombe house got arrested.
Because I had opted to stay out of it,
I was the last man standing in that Palo Mayombe house.
I was also finished with magic.
I wanted out.
It wasn't the end of my journey,
no more than the Plejerans were.
It was just something more I'd learned.


I had to find another godfather in another Palo Mayombe house in another part of California to blood out.
You have to do the blood out ritual or the spirits that are associated with you,
and by this time I had quite a few cauldrons,
will haunt and torment you for the rest of your life.
You need to realize that you've begun a feeding relationship with them.
It's like a dog.
You can't just stop feeding a dog.
You're going to get bit.
So I packed all my cauldrons and one big bathtub I had into a truck and drove out to the desert to meet another godfather from another house.
We did the transfer ritual and I blooded out,
and that was the end of my life in Palo Mayombe.


The blood magic practiced in Palo Mayombe is one of the most literal forms of magic in the world.
It's very effective.
I watched it work.
I bear witness.
However,
It's not the only magic in the world.
The actual construction of human consciousness is a magical instrument.
Our thoughts and feelings are a form of magic in that they help contribute to the reality in our timeline.
You may have heard this in various nonsensical new age publications,
explained in a kind of ham-fisted opportunistic way as all of that new age crap usually is,
but fundamentally it's true.
You are responsible for your thoughts and feelings and your thoughts and feelings contribute to your timeline in this life and your timeline in your next incarnation if you're not cycling out of the game.
Almost everything down here is voluntary.
People have this idea that they're being forced to do things.
At the end of the day, you're not even forced to incarnate.
It's all done voluntarily.



Now I'm going to explain to you some of the deeper magic on the planet using the intentional energy of human consciousness.
The first thing you need to understand is that very few people are powerful enough in their unfoldment and their energy of source let's call it, or godhead energy,
to transform reality miraculously.
It can certainly be seen in some of the Himalayan masters who take up the Vedic initiations and spend their whole lives meditating in the mountains in that region of the Himalayas,
which is known as the enlightenment center of the world,
stretching as far as Tibet,
which was profoundly influenced by Indian culture.
There are,
however,
people and groups who understand the power of intentional energy and use large groups of people and harness their intentional energy to manifest their reality.
This is,
in essence,
the very definition of the priestcraft on the planet today,
the Abrahamic minions,
whether they be rabbis,
Catholic priests,
or Muslim imams,
they are all using the power of their congregants and that collective consciousness to mold energy in the world,
and,
at the higher levels,
they are using the entire population to direct energy.
Our governments do it as well.
When they want to move the human population in a certain direction they run a false flag.
A false flag is a fake terrorist or military operation that is used to create panic and disorderly thinking and in that panic and disorderly thinking, the government comes in and redirects the nation.
September eleventh, 2001 was a ritual to redirect the free world.
It's all magic.
If there's one thing that could save the world more quickly than anything else it's that individual human beings come to understand the value of their consciousness and stop giving over their energies to other people and entities.
That one thing alone would make such a difference in the world it would be almost unbelievable.


But it's not so easy to go back to free thinking anymore, is it?
We don't control any aspect of our lives anymore.
Mammon and his money system can dictate when we panic and when we are relaxed by contracting the food supply in the supply chain,
which is what is going on with all of the virus and quarantine nonsense we're living through in  2020.
The money system is the greatest magical system for controlling human beings on the planet.
The moment we took ourselves off of land and water and committed ourselves to an enterprise of rapid development
&mdash;
the endless futurism with the space fantasy,
the false promise of eradicating poverty,
health and longevity,
and anything they can dangle to morally support their destructive consumption of resources
&mdash;
we gave up our spiritual relationships with the creation and we entered into collective chaos.
The collective chaos of the Western world,
especially the United States,
has brought the world to the brink of imbalance and chaos,
which may have been the goal of the dark side from the beginning,
a thinly-veiled depopulation agenda masquerading as us doing ourselves in.


If there is one thing I would like readers to take away from this book it's that each and every one of us is a captain of our ship in a life that extends over many dimensions of existence.
My story mainly deals with this third dimension and the one just over it,
the fourth dimension.
Human beings have been given a passport to go into all of these dimensions if our vibration and behavior is correct.
The entire cosmos is ours to explore if we simply live correctly.
Unfortunately, 
we have been brought to the basest of impulses in our behavior at a time when the manifested technology on the planet is at its highest since Atlantis.
The technology is its own cult.
Most of the world doesn't even know what technology exists or what it can do.
Religious puppets are put in front of us like this ridiculous Pope Francis the pedophile and child sacrifice ritualist.
The Jewish people are no better off with the murderous and fully black magic Sanhedrin,
now wanting its Third Temple of Solomon to perform sacrifices within, 
and Islam is teetering towards the darkness now,
believing that some holy Jihad can wipe Satan from the Earth.
Satan doesn't live on the earth except through human beings and occasional visits.
Satan lives in another dimension.
Killing human beings will not kill the Satanic influence.


If there is one thing that the human race lacks now it's true and good spiritual direction.
The very worst paths on the planet are these Abrahamic paths steeped in their ridiculous prophecies which,
through the power of intentional energy and generational thought on the prophecies,
become self-fulfilling prophecies.
Human life is so short that if someone is not sincere in attaining knowledge about how this world goes together from thought and feeling to manifestation and what happens to us after we die they're not going to come to any clarity or knowledge and they're just going to be another soldier drone in the black magician Army that runs this planet through the Abrahamic religions,
giving over their intentional energy to robed bandits.


The extraterrestrials who have interfered with us have not done us any favors as well.
As I told you,
the Abrahamic religions were originally a Plejeran experiment.
But the Plejeran are an imperfect people in themselves.
The reptilian race snuck into the teachings through King Solomon and formed a line of magic that is populated by groups under many religious banners now.
There are good reptilians.
But by and large, 
the influence of the reptilian culture upon the human race has been altogether negative.


Human beings don't figure out these complicated black magic systems with naming and numbering for various spirits.
Pull your head out of your ass.
These things are given to the human race,
and,
in many instances, 
they're given to cause harm.
Gematria and numerology were given to the Hebrews,
and they have degenerated into the blackest of magic on the planet.
Extraterrestrials are never going to land here and completely dominate us.
They don't need to.
They can do it just by invading and influencing our consciousness with the temptations they present to us.
They're not stupid.
They're not going to violate cosmic law.
The consequence of destroying a race is quite epic in cosmic law.
Neither the Plejeran nor the reptilians are going to violate that universal law.
What they do is give us the rope to hang ourselves.
We do it to ourselves.
