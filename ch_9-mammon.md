Mammon
==========


The importance of The Worshipful Company of Fuellers is that it marks the time in our history when we institutionalized usury.
It also marks the beginning of institutional Satanism.
It's important to understand that this had been a major issue in Europe.
Usury had been outlawed by the Vatican.
It was hypocritical.
They borrowed money themselves.
They had banks in Italy preceding the Bank of England,
but the Bank of England took it to a new level.
Our timeline reveals the consequences of that decision.
The British became a powerful force in the world when they adopted the Babylonian money magic.
Money is the ultimate magic.
When you think about magic from a human perspective it's nothing more then manifestation.
Money allows us to manifest a desire instantly.
Money has become the main thing that every human being thinks about.
It's very important that magic be understood.
It runs the world.
It doesn't matter that you don't believe in it.
It doesn't require your belief.
It operates on its own principles.
It's scientific.
Science is a form of magic.
Ritual is the ancestor of formula.




From the starting point of the Bank of England we can map the modern world to its present state.
The bank notes expanded the wealth through the fractional reserve model of operation.
The trick behind this magic is simple;
if you have one thousand dollars of gold in reserve,
you may create in paper the amount allowed by the reserve fraction.
By way of illustration,
if the reserve rate is one to four,
which means that for every thousand dollars in reserve,
where the reserve is defined by a universally acceptable value of wealth like gold,
the wealth issuance can total four thousand.
So you have one thousand in gold and three thousand in paper loaned by the four to one ratio.
How can they do this,
you might ask.
By studying human beings,
they realized that only a percentage of the people with gold in reserve would ask for it at any given time.
Once the paper was in circulation and accepted as a form of exchange,
there was no reason to go back to gold.
It was much easier to walk around with coin or paper notes in your purse than it was to lug around a weight of gold.
The paper manifested very quickly,
and human behavior changed very quickly around the paper.
The social structure changed.
Women didn't have to wait for a suitor to marry them to gain independence from their parents.
They could sell their bodies for the paper.
Prostitution has flourished in a few kinds of societies.
One is a society in which slave workers are kept and slave prostitutes are kept as a reward,
but the most common one is the one with money.
The moment wealth was liberated from land and water by definition,
which is the baseline and correct definition of wealth,
all manner of spontaneous manifestation emerges.
The connection between money and sex is profound.
The more prolific money is in your society,
the more degraded the family unit will be,
the more promiscuous the people will be,
the more depraved the men,
and the more opportunistic the women.
It's almost as though something unnatural is thrown into a natural construction.
When I talk about these things people say to me,
yes,
but Robert,
peasants lived horrible lives.
Did they?
They worked three or four months a year on their land,
either owned or leased from the king.
They had music,
culture,
family,
and an inner life,
a quiet space within themselves.
We have none of those things now.
We have smart phones,
smart televisions,
computers,
processed foods produced by diabolical agricultural *corporations*,
and titled persons living professional lives in mega-cities with so much loneliness,
despair,
and depression that the vast majority of people require pharmacology just to cope.
The family has been destroyed.
Pornography,
prostitution,
and human trafficking are multi-billion if not trillion dollar industries,
but we're happier,
we're better off than the European peasant?
I don't think so.
What's more alarming is once the baseline of comparison is gone,
the people who lived and worked on land,
we won't even have their consciousness in our collective anymore;
we won't even have people to tell us how far we've gone off track.
You don't want to lose your direction in the dark.
You'll never get it back.


The modern society begun in England by the Bank of England commenced as a result of religious warfare. 
The Jews had been exiled from over one hundred European nations for usury and suspicion of child ritual sacrifice,
which they deny.
The usury they do not deny.
In many instances the monarchy of the nation that permitted Jews to live within its borders actually used the money lending services of the Jews themselves. 
This included the Vatican itself.
This is an extremely important point to understand.
The bank notes allowed the British Monarchy to develop their navy and to begin exploring the world.
Exploring is a bit of a misnomer.
They pillaged.
Like all military empires,
the British saw themselves as a light in the world.
They were bringing light to these poor and miserable nations that had not seen the light of Britain.


The tendency to conquest has always existed in human affairs.
You only need to look at history.
The one exception to the conquest rule might be China.
The Chinese have been a largely introspective nation until recently.
All that has changed with the Belt and Road Initiative.
The Chinese were brought into the modern world.
Before that they were referred to as the hermit nation.
They considered the world barbaric and primitive and wanted nothing to do with it.


The real origin of the money system is Babylon.
A fiat currency was used in Babylon.
A fiat currency is a currency that is unsupported by any underlying wealth.
It's a kind of confidence game.
The line of wealth from literal to metaphorical is land,
minerals,
then bank notes,
or credit notes.
In the early nineteen-seventies Richard Nixon took the United States off of the gold standard.
Up until that time all banks were operating with mineral reserves to back up their currencies.
This meant that if any foreign creditor wanted to exchange their US dollars for gold the option was available to them.
Gold was an accepted universal standard of wealth in most of the world.



Throughout the Cold War the capital system remained equitable for the creation of a middle-class.
The North American middle class and the Western European middle class existed from the end of World War II until coming up to the end of the millennium.
There's still a middle-class,
it's just that it's percentage of the overall population is quite small now.
It has been relegated to a small group of successful entrepreneurs and titled professionals,
lawyers,
chartered accountants,
chartered financial analysts,
dentists,
veterinarians,
just about anywhere you need a license to work in government supervision and regulation
&mdash;
a kind of defacto extension of the public service
&mdash;
you'll find the remainder of the middle class.
It's very important to note that this successful middle class is largely created and sustained by the government and its regulations.
It's an artificial economy,
or,
if artificial is too caustic for you,
a support economy,
especially the titles related to law and money.
If we didn't exist they wouldn't exist.
There is no law if there are not two or more parties seeking conflict resolution.
Chartered accountants aren't needed unless there are corporations needing book keeping.
Nowhere do we see anything natural here.
It's all incorporations.
The corpus is the body.[^12]

>corpus noun\
>a collection of written or spoken texts\
>a corpus of 100 million words of spoken English\
>the whole corpus of Renaissance poetry\
>SEE ALSO habeas corpus\

>Word Origin\
>late Middle English (denoting a human or animal body): from Latin, literally ‘body’. The current sense dates from the early 18th cent.






The average North American city provides an excellent example of the middle class.
In the early 1970s,
right around the time Nixon took America and subsequently the world off the gold standard,
the average annual income in the United States was about eight to ten thousand dollars and the average home price was about eight to sixteen thousand dollars.
We're talking about a normal home in which a family could be raised.
If you flash forward to 2020,
fifty years after Nixon took us off the gold standard,
the average price of a home in Toronto is a million dollars and the average annual income is fifty thousand dollars.
The annual labor before taxation required to buy a home went from a one-to-one ratio in the early seventies to a one-to-twenty ratio in the early part of the twenty-first century.
It's also coincidental to know that the fractional reserve the banks in Canada are operating under is twenty to one.
It's reached the point in Toronto that the young generation have given up on ever owning a home.
Unless you come from a family that gives you the down payment,
then the idea that you're ever going to own a home is a dead dream.
How could North America come to this?
It was founded and built on the realization that class and nobility had robbed human beings of property in Europe.
It arrived where it's because we didn't break away from the birth culture.
We imported the birth culture when we brought in their central banks.
This has been the case with many countries.


Where did our present culture come from?
It came from England.
Not only the banks but the entire philosophy of materialism and building.
Oxford is the world's oldest English language university,
starting around the eleventh century.
It's impacted the whole world because of the dominance of the English language,
which has become the defacto international language,
in no small part due to the English naval advantage in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
and our unashamed certitude of cultural superiority.
In many ways it was the second Roman Empire,
and America may be looked upon as the final extension of this,
with contemporary America showing all the signs of a decaying Roman capital.
This of course is only the political characterization.
Spiritually,
both Britain and America are extensions of Egypt,
and the ancient cultures Egypt absorbed which preceded her reign upon time's stage.

In many ways Oxford may be looked upon as the cradle of modern civilization.
So much of the world's systems originated in Britain,
and because of Oxford's place in the creation of those systems and the education of those who maintain the systems globally now,
we can clearly see Oxford's place in the molding of the modern world.
Remember,
since Rome reinvented itself as a theological empire instead of a military one,
the name of the game has been ideological empire.
It doesn't matter whether it's religious or ideological anymore,
but it enters through your thoughts.
It's a mental colonization.



Let's use Gandhi as an example,
the pseudo-observant,
pseudo-classless lackey of London City,
who,
if you can't see it now,
a century later,
was a servant of the British.
Gandhi was a master of publicity and public relations long before Edward Bernays wrote his treatise on the subject or Madison Avenue started it's marketing and advertising virus of the mind.
He used to make a big show of riding in the poor car on the Indian rail system.
The poor car was the cheapest ticket and people were crammed in there like animals and very often there were animals in the poor car like goats and chickens.
It was advertised far and wide that Gandhi refused the luxury of first class,
but what was withheld from the public was that when he rode in the poor car he demanded that he have the entire car to himself,
thus depriving the poor of their means of transportation when he had to go from point A to point B.
He was a graduate of the *Inner Temple*,
described as follows.

>The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple, commonly known as the Inner Temple, is one of the four Inns of Court (professional associations for barristers and judges) in London. To be called to the Bar and practise as a barrister in England and Wales, a person must belong to one of these Inns. It is located in the wider Temple area of the capital, near the Royal Courts of Justice, and within the City of London.


Mahatma Gandhi's tenure at the Inner Temple in London does not directly connect him to Oxford,
but he is most certainly connected to the education system of Britain which served as the ideological seed for the present global system.
India has,
however,
been profoundly affected by Oxford University.
Let's look first at Indira Gandhi.
She was the first and only female Prime Minister of India.
She was killed by her Sikh bodyguards for ordering a military incursion into the Golden Temple,
the holiest of sites for the Sikh religion.
Indira Gandhi was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru,
the first Prime Minister of India.
She occupied the office from January 1966 to March 1977 and again from January 1980.

>As Prime Minister, Gandhi was known for her political intransigency and unprecedented centralisation of power.[^13]

[^13]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi

The key thing to note in the excellent biographic missive by our friends at Wikipedia is the following:
*unprecedented centralisation of power*.
This was for suppression of the organic culture,
spiritual culture,
in this case the Sikhs,
who defied the British derived directive of centralized power through their infected host Gandhi.


It is an unfortunate characteristic of the post-modern age in which we live that the concept of infection by virus is limited to the body.
Man in fact has five bodies,
or five centers of interpretation:
the physical,
the emotional,
the mnemonic,
the mental,
and the soul,
which is the pure perception that sits behind all of these bodies.


It is my contention that all four of our foundational bodies are infected,
and the Typhoid Mary that poisoned the world world was Britain and its surrogate America.
Our emotional bodies have been infected with sentiment.
Our memories have been infected with lies and false history.
Our minds are infected with ideologies.
Only the soul stands above infection,
however,
it has to navigate a layered perception through the four other bodies,
or faculties of man working in unison to reveal truth to the soul.


The antagonist to perception is deception,
and deception can only be practiced by another sentient being.
Nature cannot deceive us.
The constellations of our night skies cannot deceive us.
Oxford is the first and most powerful distribution point for the infection.
It's like the tents from which the colonists passed out smallpox infected blankets to North American indigenous peoples in an effort to usurp their land.
While Gandhi did get the English out of India as a physically occupying force,
he completely reinforced their ideologies and left all of their institutions in place.
He stayed loyal to the *Inner Temple*.



The capital system maintained a pretense of equity through the Cold War.
They really had to.
If they had shown their true face at that time communism probably would run the world right now.
Please do not confuse what I'm saying here with an endorsement of communism and a denigration of capitalism.
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm talking about the way the systems are applied.
I'm not talking about their theoretical constructs.
It was always the intent of the money masters to treat people as cruelly as the communist system did.
They just had to lay in wait until the communist system was defeated.
They had to make capitalism look as an ideal choice when compared to the misery and deprivation of the communist system.
For those of you who didn't grow up in that time,
it was not uncommon to see pictures of people lined up for toilet paper in the Soviet Union.
Our media was constantly pointing out micro famines and supply deficits in the communist system,
with the principle that free market enterprise was much better at meeting the needs of people over the government micro-managing every industry the way the Soviet system did.
They were absolutely correct.
Human beings are always better off when they're left to sort things out for themselves.
So what changed?



In 1989 the Berlin Wall came down and the Soviet Union collapsed under the gentle guidance of Mikhail Gorbachev's Glasnost and Perestroika programs.
The moment that wall came down,
the grinning Satanist,
George Bush Senior,
stood before the cameras and told us that the new threat was terrorism and that America and its allies had to remain vigilant,
and he took the moment to point out that with the collapse of the Soviet Union a new world order was coming about.



The removing of the gold standard by Nixon was to liquidate the markets with capital to inflate the lifestyle of the Western world.
It's impossible to believe that the architects of this new monetary system in which the dollar floated on nothing but faith could see a future for it that would survive in the complex global trading system we find ourselves in in 2020.
At the exact same time the Berlin Wall came down free trade commenced.
The early pioneers of free trade were the Japanese who wanted to create an Asian trading zone.
America responded by creating a free trade deal first with Canada and then extending it into Mexico as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),
now the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMC).
What free trade did was allow the cupidity of corporations to come to its full expression.
It's in 1989 that Mammon is let off his leash,
birthed in 1684 with the Bank of England.
We first begin to see the automobile industry completely deconstructed from its North American base and shipped off to places like Mexico,
where the big car manufacturers could get their labor for cents on the dollar.
The Canadians and Americans were told that their dividend would be cheaper automobiles,
essentially that the savings the corporations made would be passed on to the consumer.
What the gullible North Americans didn't realize was that when the jobs left the consumer base would be dilapidated.
With the consumer base dilapidated nobody would be able to buy a car.


At the center of the modern global financial system is the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Their description is as follows:[^15]

[^15]: https://www.imf.org/en/About

>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an organization of 189 countries,
working to foster global monetary cooperation,
secure financial stability,
facilitate international trade,
promote high employment and sustainable economic growth,
and reduce poverty around the world.


>Created in 1945, the IMF is governed by and accountable to the 189 countries that make up its near-global membership.


>The IMF's primary purpose is to ensure the stability of the international monetary system &mdash; the system of exchange rates and international payments that enables countries (and their citizens) to transact with each other.
The Fund's mandate was updated in 2012 to include all macroeconomic and financial sector issues that bear on global stability.



Like so many things in the Satanic system,
the IMF is nearly the exact opposite of what is described in their mission statement online.
The IMF has been responsible for the destruction of countries.
Its primary goal is to offer money to developing countries and mid-sized countries to get everybody into the debt system.
Once the country is involved in the debt system they enter into a spiral from which they can never escape.
The IMF ends up spending more and more time dictating to the debtor country what it must do.
Eventually the country ends up losing control of its primary natural resources,
which get sold off in a nepotistic auction to balance debt.
The first major expose in the public space on the IMF was done by John Pilger in the 1980s.
He ruthlessly examined the effect of the IMF's incursion into Indonesia when it was run by globalist puppet,
Suharto,
a black magician of great repute.
The Suharto family ended up absconding from their own country with tens of billions in personal accounts while the country was left hobbled and handicapped by the malfeasance of the Suharto regime with the full complicity of the IMF.


The goal of the monetary system is to take over countries.
It has been since the formation of the International Monetary Fund,
the World Bank,
and the Bank of International Settlements.
They didn't really get off and running until the end of the Cold War.
Russia to this day remains very antagonistic to the presence of the International Monetary Fund within its governance.
It is also one of the most pragmatic countries in the modern capital based system when it comes to allowing debt to accrue to foreign lenders.
So the question becomes what is the end game of the IMF?
Its total ownership of every resource on the planet,
air,
water,
land,
and everything else that allows human beings to exist on this planet.
It's yet another attempt to compromise the autonomy of human beings as a divine and sovereign being.
When we are divine and sovereign we can use our imaginations to connect with the creator.
When we are internally occupied by falsely generated worries like a financial system that unduly burdens us with stress then we do not commune property in our internal space.


When you think about the truth of money,
that it's simply a metaphor,
a representation of the real wealth from the planet,
which is land,
air,
and water,
why would you trade the paper for the real wealth?
It can only happen in a world where human beings are so confused and so Satanically misdirected that they don't understand what the real nature of the transaction is.
It also helps that money can manifest any desire you have very rapidly.
Money becomes the ultimate magical instrument for manifestation.
It's really a portable form of magic.
The magic has already been done and accepted by the general population.
If you have a weakness for flesh,
money can fulfill all the fantasies that pollute your imagination.
If you want to do some good and help somebody who may be in a bad situation then money can buy the best medical care on the planet.
Money is instant manifestation.
But if you take the magic you lose your connection with your autonomy.
You lose your connection with air,
the earth,
the land,
and the water.
You lose your soul connection.

In theology we have always viewed Mammon as love of money,
but it's much more than that once you understand what money is.
It's manifestation and energy.
You can manifest almost anything you want on the earth if you have enough money.
Those without money place their attention on it.
That attention is an intentional energy that goes to those with money.
They steal your energy,
or,
in another sense,
you give them your energy.
But,
like so much in this world,
this is only the surface story.
The real story on this planet is the battle for souls.
You're the prize.
The money is only a means to capture you.
There's nothing wrong with pursuing money.
It's needed to survive,
buy food,
provide opportunity to your children,
and many other noble intentions.
In the end it really doesn't matter,
though.
The very nature of money is magical,
and magic is the province of the negative principalities.
