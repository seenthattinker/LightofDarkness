Weights and Measures
========================

And that,
dear readers,
is the story of our malignant Western Society in the early part of the twenty-first century.
So many things have gone into getting us here.
I've tried my best to make you aware of all of them in this story that Bruce and I have told.
The Abrahamic narrative that has migrated into Jesus and Mohammad has become like a rugby game where every side is fighting for control of the ball.
It's a shit show.



Here's the good news.
If we can realize what we've been through and who put us through it,
the ability to come out the other end with a profit is highly likely.
It's kind of ironic that the prophets may have profited us.
This story is long overdue.
A lot of different people have tried to hint at it but just haven't had the balls to come right out and say it.
The former Canadian Defense and Finance Minister,
Paul Hellyer,
comes to mind.
He might be the highest ranking official to document the extraterrestrial presence on earth.
When he started his post-political life in Canada,
he formed the Action Party of Canada in the nineteen eighties.
Its mission was to inform people that the money system was a fraud and that if we kept using a usury based central banking system where all central banks were funded by an international source,
we would end in ruin,
bankruptcy,
despair,
and catastrophe,
almost exactly what you see on the television news these days.


Behind all of the nonsensical and fraudulent economic theories that are pandered by the University of Chicago,
Harvard,
the London School of Economics,
and anywhere else these shit heels gather to lie to us,
is a real economy.
This economy is governed by our thoughts and feelings and the intentional energy we put into the world.
That intentional energy we have is a diminutive form of the spirit that animates our lives.
Most people corrupt the holy spirit when they run it through their consciousness because they don't know what it is and they don't know what it's doing.
But it's always working.
It never sleeps.
Every action,
thought,
and feeling that commences from one human being sets in motion a cycle of cause and effect that resolves itself whenever the governing force decides it is most appropriate.
We have a lot of debts coming due as a Western civilization.
Our priestcraft in the Christian and Jewish worlds were hijacked by very dark forces,
and because it's taking us so long to figure this out,
we're dealing with a highly delinquent credit card.
The world is almost done with our bullshit.
Can you blame them?


So what are our options?
I think our best option is the Alcoholics Anonymous option.
We first need to hit rock bottom to gain the humility to admit we have a problem.
Once that happens,
we need to set on a path of restitution to undo some of the wrongs that we have done.
Not all the evil in the world has come out of the Western world,
and I surely do not mean to say that good things have not come out of the Western world.
The British at least left schools and hospitals where they went,
and we Americans have not done all bad.
We maintain the balance in a highly precarious world.
But we have to stop the bullshit now.
We have to stop these Satanic cults that have snuck themselves into institutions and are supercharging the world with negative and destructive energy.


Bruce and I want to take a moment to apologize for the emotional horror we put you through in our book.
If you've made it this far then you really want to be part of the solution.
We apologize for pulling the curtain back on the evil in this world and showing it to you naked and undiluted,
but Bruce and I decided that this story could no longer be watered down.
Like we said in the first chapter,
there's a flood of information and a drought on context.
Our job in the telling of my story,
The Light Of Darkness,
was to give you that context.
Now you have it.
What are you going to do with it?


Bruce and I leave you with a story from the Guardian newspaper from 2018.
It's about a town in Mexico that fired its mayor and its police force and chased out all the gangsters,
the cartel people.
We're not suggesting that this is the solution for America and its allies,
but it's definitely a starting point for constructive thought.
Our money system is collapsing now.
We as human beings need to figure out ways to survive independent of the Satanic web that has brought us to this point in the first quarter of the twenty-first century.


###The Mexican indigenous community that ran politicians out of town

*Cheran, in the violent state of Michoacan, will stand apart from Mexico’s electioneering season, having tackled corruption and exploitation by banishing political parties, police and gangsters*

Party publicity, such as here in the capital, is ubiquitous in small Mexican towns and villages, but not in Cheran, where murals denounce political parties and exalt the revolutionary Emiliano Zapata.

Election publicity is ubiquitous in small Mexican towns and villages, but not in Cheran, where murals denounce political parties and exalt the revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. 


All across Mexico, political billboards are springing up and candidates are hitting the streets, as campaigning starts for elections to pick a new president, renew the congress and replace hundreds of state and local officials.

Everywhere, that is, except for one small corner of the violent Western state of Michoacan, which has found a simple solution to the vote-buying and patronage which plague Mexican democracy.

The indigenous Purepecha town of Cheran threw out all political parties after a popular uprising in 2011 – and it doesn’t want them back.

“The only thing the parties have done is divide us,” said Salvador Ceja, Cheran’s communal lands commissioner. “Not just here – in the entire country.”

Presidential campaigns officially kicked off at the weekend, and polls put the left-leaning populist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador – ahead of his closest challenger by double digits.

The elections come amid widespread despair at the country’s worsening security crisis and disgust at political corruption. Antipathy toward political parties runs strong in Mexico: a recent survey found they were the least-trusted institution in the country.


But Cheran has taken its contempt for parties to an extreme.



Much of that antipathy can be traced back to the situation in the early part of the decade, when the surrounding area was dominated by illegal loggers, who clearcut local forests and hauled out dozens of truckloads of logs each week &mdash; with the protection of a local drug cartel, and the collusion of corrupt police and local politicians.

Eventually, the townspeople decided they had enough. Early on 15 April 2011, local residents ran off the loggers and blockaded the town. Then they kicked out the mayor and banished political parties, arguing that infighting was what had allowed the town to fall into crisis.

Constant intrigues in the main political grouping meant that the villagers could never come together to confront major problems – such as the illegal logging – said Pedro Chavez Sanchez, the head of the 12-member council that now governs Cheran.

The council, which is renewed every three years, was formed after the 2011 uprising and eventually ruled constitutional by Mexico’s supreme court.

Neighbourhood assemblies will select a new council on 1 July – the same day as the presidential election. But no ballot boxes will be installed in Cheran, meaning that anyone wanting to vote for president will have to travel to neighbouring communities. 


“We can’t put a project like this at risk in order to participate” in the federal election, Chavez said. “If we let in an election like this, with polling stations and all that accompanies that, the parties are going to want to get back in here.”

Political parties have occasionally attempted to campaign in the town, only to be escorted out by the local ronda – the citizen-run security force formed after the uprising.

Instead of party publicity – ubiquitous in small Mexican towns and villages – walls in Cheran, are emblazoned with murals invoking the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata or denouncing political parties.

“Asshole parties,” reads one. “Cheran is not a toy.”

Before the uprising, residents allege, local politicians not only turned a blind eye to drug trafficking and extortion, but financed their campaigns with illegal logging and attempted to seize control of common lands.

“All the previous authorities belonging to political parties, every time one them finished their term, they’d take everything with them,” said Ceja.

Academics studying Cheran say the new council has largely contained corruption. Council members are paid modestly, and held to account by the neighbourhood assemblies, said Benjamín Fernandez, a sociologist at the Centre for Research and Higher Studies in Social Anthropology (Ciesas), who has studied Cheran.

The community has also had success protecting the environment and reforesting the region.

Michoacan is one of Mexico’s most violent regions, but local officials say that not a single kidnapping or extortion attempt has been reported since the uprising.

“Cheran’s main achievement has been peace,” said Fernandez. “It has the lowest homicide rate in all of Michoacan – and maybe all of Mexico outside of the south-eastern state of Yucatan.”

In a country where drug-fuelled violence and political corruption are reach ever-greater extremes, Cheran occupies an almost mythical place in the popular imagination as a rare success story.

So the town was particularly shaken by the murder in January of Guadalupe Campanur, 32, whose body was found just outside the municipality.

Campanur was one of the first women to join the ronda and actively participated in neighbourhood assemblies. Initial reports suggested that she had been targeted for her work on ecological projects, but friends and community officials said she was not in a leadership position. State officials say a suspect has been detained.

And despite the success of the town’s political project, it is not insulated from outside forces: regional political parties are reportedly trying to get sympathisers elected to the council.

Local activists are insistent, however, that they will not be allowed to return to Cheran

“Our project,” Ceja said, “is for 30 years.”
