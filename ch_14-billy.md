The Plejerans
================

Intense pressure was put on me to rejoin the navy after 911.
All the team guys were getting called back up.
Pete the Pirate got called back up.
He kept pressuring me to come back.
I told him about my two back operations.
He said it didn't matter.
Everyone I knew was going back.
It was a cash cow.
But my son was in the world,
my first,
and just recently born,
and I was transfixed by him,
by the love of him,
by the duty of him,
by the responsibility of him. 
I said no to reenlisting.

For team guys,
and when I say *team guys* I mean elite soldiers,
that shit show in New York,
Washington,
and Pennsylvania was cash work.
I understand.
I did my share of *work* too.
It's the only part of this story I've skipped over.
The Richard Kane story is the tip of the iceberg,
the end of a kind of living for me.
I told it so you would understand what really goes on in the high-level contracting world.
To my brothers in the teams,
both active and retired,
I need to say it's not good that we look the other way on moral righteousness.
We can all add our names and our class or profession
&mdash;
elite operators
&mdash;
to the long list of people who didn't do a thing,
the professionals who knew,
architects,
structural engineers,
the silent mass of people who sat by and said nothing,
shame on us.

Every profession in the world has a dark side.
Ours in the elite operator class is taking blood money for blood work,
and 911 was blood money for blood work.
As a profession,
we lose our center when we do this,
and we loose anarchy in our own hearts and minds,
and one day or night we find ourselves alone,
a firearm in our mouths.
Some of us pull the trigger.
Some of us don't.
I did.
The pistol malfunctioned.
I took it apart afterwards.
There was nothing wrong with it,
but,
when I wanted to end my life,
it didn't work.
Life wasn't finished with me yet.
What I want to say to you,
my bothers in arms,
is *they* know what they're doing with the blood work.
They want to corrupt us.
They want the pistol in our mouths.
We're witnesses,
credible witnesses to at least the footnotes of their diabolical nature. 
Sure,
maybe you can trust a witness to keep their mouth shut,
after all, 
a complicit witness has something to lose too,
but we have something they don't have,
a purer heart.
We couldn't do what we do without the energy of our hearts.
They don't use their hearts.
Most of the taskmasters in the private contracting world are into this Satanic underworld as well.
That's why they never end up with the pistol in their mouths.

I settled into being a dad,
and I went to war with my son's mother.
She left him behind,
abandoned both of us,
and for some time I had to be a mother and a father.
My son opened my heart like a thousand prayers.
I watched Pete the pirate go back into service.

In this time,
in the opening of my heart,
I started going back to Mormon services.
I wanted to be right for my son.
I wanted to be a good man,
but something kept tickling my serenity.
It was like an itch I couldn't scratch.
The encounter with the CIA man in the Philippines left a permanent curiosity in me.
My consciousness had always been open.
I was no stranger to the other side.
As told in this story,
I had attended exorcisms in the Mormon Church.
I'd seen the things Father Malachi Martin spoke about in *Hostage to the Devil*,
his seminal work on exorcism in the Catholic Church.
The phenomenon he described was real.
I'd seen it myself,
but something didn't add up.
What were those non-human beings I'd seen when my spirit spoke to me at the bar in the Philippines?
The men around the table,
described as The Committee of Three Hundred,
were all real.
I recognized many of them.
George Bush Senior was there.
John McCain stood behind him at his seat.
Everyone sitting at the table had a *second* standing behind him,
like an understudy in a Royal Shakespeare Company production.
What I saw,
what my spirit showed me in that bar in the Philippines was real.
And those strange non-human beings I saw were real
&mdash;
black hats and black suits.
I knew they weren't human.
They were not of this world.
They didn't correlate to any spiritual phenomenon I had been taught in my religious studies.
They were extraterrestrial.
As I mulled it over in my peaceful time as father of a toddler,
I instinctively knew they were not the men in black spoken about in the exopolitics circles.
My spirit kept telling me the same thing
&mdash;
they are the controllers.
My mind balked.
The spirit and the mind are in constant conflict in spiritual evolution.
The mind is the censor
&mdash;
that can't be right;
that's crazy;
people will think you're crazy;
be quiet.
It fights the spirit at every step.
In the architecture of man,
the mind is the devil and the spirit's the path to the true self,
the particle of the creator,
the drop of water in the ocean of love and mercy.
In the literature on possession,
both in the Catholic and Mormon Churches,
the invading spirit comes in through the mind.
It begins as an idea.
This is brilliantly detailed in *Hostage to the Devil*.
So what were these controllers?
They weren't possessing spirits.
They seemed an order of magnitude beyond them.
They occupied the power centers,
The Committee of Three Hundred.


At this time in my life I was very disoriented.
My time in the military and my private contracting career had left spots on my soul.
It was hard to get light into my thinking and my perspective.
There is an aspect of the human composition that is like an internal tribunal.
I suppose that's a fancy way of saying conscience,
but that seems too limited.
The conscience has always seemed like a mental faculty to me.
Philosophy,
of which the Germans excelled,
seems to be the thesis of the conscience,
a non-stop mental exercise on moral reasoning.
This,
at least to my sensibilities,
is wrong.
The knowledge of right and wrong is like a feeling,
but that even seems to limit it.
Feeling can be so many debased things.
It seems to me to be a direct dialogue with the soul,
which has no characteristics but its own being.
In my cosmology to define the soul it becomes a little like what they call negative space in sculpture,
which is the space not occupied by anything,
the clay or marble taken away from the sculpture.
The soul,
to me,
is what exists when you take away body and sense,
emotion,
memory,
and the mind,
the last being the most difficult to move beyond,
with the whole of Buddhist liturgy being a negotiation with the mind,
a pleading for the mind to let the pure perception free,
but it's a contradiction because pleading is a mental activity.
The soul is that it is.
Descartes was wrong when he said,
*I think therefore I am*.
To me it's more like,
I am in spite of the fact that I think.

I had bad dreams,
bad moods,
a million questions,
and a lingering clairvoyance that had been growing since my childhood,
and which had gone to graduate school when I met the CIA spook in the Philippines.
I could just see things.
My inner life was crystal clear.
My inner vision was better than my eyesight.
It's hard to describe.
Some of you reading this know exactly what I'm talking about.
Others not so much.
It might be something that can only be experienced and not explained,
but I'll try my best.
When I met people it's like I could see inside their heads.
I became a symbiant to their inner lives.
I saw what it was like to be them.
I felt what it was like.
And I could see things in their own consciousness field which they thought was part of their thinking process but was in actuality a leech of some sort.
Some of them appeared just as amorphous black forms like liquid smoke.
Sometimes they were dead human beings which had latched onto the person.
Sometimes I saw the controllers,
black hats and suits.
I started to get downloaded with massive amounts of information.
I made connections.
The color black was the control color for the planet.
The black robes of judges and barristers.
The black suits and hats of Jesuits and rabbis,
but they very often didn't know themselves they were agents of the controllers. 
When I saw the room in my inner vision at the bar in the Philippines,
the room that I was told was The Committee of Three Hundred,
some of the men in the room were aware of the controllers,
but not all of them.
I later learned that the controllers ran the ritual culture,
but the participants thought they were in Satanic-Luciferian cults.
The controllers did this because they feed off our energy.
The energy they consume is always negative.
The more negative the richer the energy for them.
This is not to say that there were not other non-physical entities feeding at the rituals.
There were.
These I would call lower or negative spirit forms.
If you want to call them demonic then that's okay.
I won't agree or disagree.
I don't know.
The controllers could create a physical circumstance and an inner circumstance.
The ritual participants believed they were going to other dimensions,
but it was like the Star Trek holodeck.
The controllers could control the human consciousness outwardly and inwardly.
They literally ran the world.
Everyone I met of power and importance had these controllers around them.



They are the controllers.
That's how they define themselves to me.
The only person who might know for sure was the spook I met at the bar,
the defacto interview for work deeper than Richard Kane. 
The interview was as much with the controllers as it was with the CIA.
The controllers run the CIA.
They run everything,
but because of their ability to mask themselves psychically,
they are known by many forms
&mdash;
demons,
Lucifer,
Satan,
Baphomet,
you name it.
They even interact with and are authoritative over the extraterrestrials.
They come and go from the earth.
When they come in large numbers they enter through things like power stations or water treatment plants.
They move around the earth by any kind of electricity or wave form generated by electricity
&mdash;
power lines,
radio waves,
Wi-Fi,
and things like this.

I ran a couple small businesses that brought in enough cash for all my needs,
but I like to keep busy.
I'm not a relaxation type person.
My son's mother abandoned us.
I had some domestic help to assist with my son.
I was living in California by the beach.
I met a guy who needed some help cleaning the underside of boats.
A lot of stuff builds up on the bottom of yachts and sailboats.
So I went to work with this guy.
I learned something very important,
something I'm going to share with you.
If you ever feel overwhelmed with negative emotions,
under psychic attack,
or demonically bothered,
go under water.
I was underwater five hours a day,
oxygen tanks on my back,
mask on my face,
and sweet,
beautiful silence all around me.
Negative psychic energy is blocked by water,
all water but especially lake or sea water,
natural water. 
I later learned that this is a spiritual truth.
Maybe this was the original reason for submerging people in water when baptized in some Christian sects.
I don't know,
but water has healing properties,
even if only by blocking out negative psychic energies and presences.
It got to the point where I loved going under the water.
After some time with the fellow who got me started,
I branched out on my own. 
I've always had tremendous success in business.
My boat cleaning operation was no exception.
I didn't steal work for my former employer.
I was just able to find a whole bunch of new clients.
The water has always been a special place for me,
going right back to my father teaching me how to scuba dive in his apartment pool.



Time passed and I settled down a little bit.
My thoughts and feelings leveled out,
thanks to the healing property of the water. 
My curiosity didn't abate.
I began to study a lot more about extraterrestrials.
I wanted to find out if anyone had experienced these controllers. 
When she worked out her issues,
my son's mother came back.
I'm a little old fashioned.
I believe the mother is more important in the developmental years.
A boy needs his father,
but all children need their mother,
so she took our son and I went to visitation.
This freed me up quite a bit.
I had plenty of time to read and research.
I went into esoteric Christianity.
I read the Gnostic Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls.
I became friends with a fellow who saw the first draft of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
What made it to the public was highly redacted.
What you need to understand is that the Bible is an extraterrestrial story.
It has also become,
from the Torah to the Koran,
a highly protected economy.


It's necessary to explain economy.
It is the lost spiritual teaching.
A life is measured.
It's measured in seconds,
minutes,
hours,
days,
weeks,
and years.
It's measured in heartbeats.
This is the true life clock,
the number of times your heart beats.
It's measured in events
&mdash;
childhood,
puberty,
school,
career,
marriage,
children,
grandchildren,
and death.
Every moment of our life is defined by spiritual growth or decline.
Our attention is the barometer.
What holds our attention?
If the attention is held by life then growth is achieved.
If the attention is boxed into a fabricated experience,
television,
for example,
then we have lost that time,
and nothing has been accomplished. 
Human attention is the greatest commodity in the spiritual economy we live within.
If someone or something can hold your attention,
then they can alter you.
This is the principle of advertising,
thirty or sixty seconds to plant an idea combined with an emotion into your consciousness.
You're not immune.
Nobody is immune.
If it were not true that they could seed you in thirty or sixty seconds they wouldn't spend a million dollars for thirty seconds at Superbowl halftime and another million dollars on the production of the Superbowl advertisement.
So the real question is,
what is your time worth to you?
I just told how much they're willing to spend for your attention,
but why don't you value your time that much?

When you live the kind of life I lived till that point in my life,
and when you tried to kill yourself but failed,
all that matters is time.
Is there enough time to unravel the mystery of yourself?
There has to be,
or the whole exercise of a human life is a cruel joke,
a pointless snuff film the Satanists celebrate in their rituals.
Never be afraid of breaking.
What breaks wasn't worth anything anyway.
Our true selves cannot be broken.
The soul cannot be broken.
We are souls.
We don't *have* souls.
We are souls.
It's another curious affectation that we say *my* soul,
as though this scab personality,
this ego would be given possession of something as precious as a soul,
so precious in fact that supernatural beings like the devil would be a curator.
Think about what I'm telling you very carefully.
You are precious.
Corporations spend money for sixty seconds of your attention.
The devil wants your soul.

As I went through the Gnostic Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls,
I became more curious about extraterrestrials.
There was something profoundly extraterrestrial about these so-called sacred texts.
Being the man I was,
which was very direct,
I went straight to the source.
I started a dialogue with a group of people who had surrounded Billy Meier.
For those of you who do not know,
Billy Meier is one of the most famous extraterrestrial contactees in the world.
His story is the stuff of legend in exopolitics circles.
I'll briefly recap the highlights here.

Billy was chosen to be contacted by the Plejerans.
The contact started when he was very young,
around five years old.
He was first contacted by an older gentleman who became his first tutor.
The contacts were not everyday or every week or even every month.
They would come into Billy's life and teach him some things and then leave for a while as he went through a developmental phase in a normal human life.
The Plejerans are humans like us.
They come from the Pleiades system.
There are many races of Plejerans.
Some do not look like us.
Billy went on to live an extraordinary life as a young man.
He traveled the Middle East and various parts of the world and his Plejeran contact introduced him to many leaders of that time and place.
If you want to know any more about the basic Billy Meier story there are countless well done documentaries on YouTube.

The point here is that the stated purpose of the contact was to return to the human race on this planet the true teachings of creation.
Billy wrote a number of books under the general heading of *Contact Notes*.
I highly recommend you take a look at them.
They are absolutely staggering in their complexity and thoroughness and give a picture of creation and the many layers to it that are similar to some of the spiritual teachings on this planet but in my opinion much more complete.
A human being goes through many lifetimes in the third dimension.
We begin in the mineral state and work out from there.
A single soul can be down here for billions of years.
I know that sounds daunting,
but I believe it to be true.
There are aspects of the Plejeran creation teachings that are scattered around the globe like the broken shards of a mirror in various religions and spiritual teachings.



What makes Billy's case so unique is the evidence that he presented.
The audio recordings of Plejeran ships and an endless array of pictures which were taken with cameras available as far back as the sixties,
at a time when faking a photo was much more difficult.
But I'm not here to sell you on the Billy Meier story.
Suffice it to say,
it's all true.
Billy is a contactee.
The Plejerans have been interacting with the human race for millennia,
and they have tried to help us.

The story gets really interesting when Billy Meier talks about Jesus,
who Billy calls by his name,
Emmanuel.
In documentary films,
Billy says simply that Mary was impregnated by an extraterrestrial.
Billy is not a stupid man.
Quite the opposite.
When I went to Switzerland and met him,
he was one of the brightest human beings I have engaged in my life.
Like so many things that Billy says,
it needs to be thought about,
long and deep.
The Biblical story has it that Mary was impregnated by an archangel.
There's no way Billy would say that Mary was impregnated by a Plejeran holy man,
an Ishwish,
without understanding the implications of what he is saying.
It's not religious post-modernism.
Billy is a farmer.
He doesn't have that urbane sophistry.
What Billy is saying is that most of the Abrahamic scripture is a Plejeran exercise.
It is the Plejeran attempt to guide and direct the human race toward spiritual growth.
The Plejerans also had a hand in Muhammad and the Koran.
Again,
in that religious story,
we are told about the archangel dictating the Koran to Muhammad.
It's also true for the Torah Prophets.
The entire Abrahamic tradition is an extraterrestrial story.
I don't know why this is so hard for people to understand.
Even having been raised Mormon it was extremely comforting for me to sit with Billy and hear these things.
It put a lot of things in place in my mind.
More importantly,
it does not diminish the value of the Abrahamic teachings in any way shape or form.
In fact,
it enriches them,
explains them,
and demystifies them for me.
Why do people have such a difficult time with the idea that the human race is part of a galactic family?



It was in Switzerland that I heard the story about Emmanuel.
He really existed.
He really is the product of an otherworldly origin.
He really did say the things that were said.
He really was all about love.
He really was sent into the world as a great teacher.
That's where the story ends.
Jesus was not crucified.
He was nailed to a y shaped tree.
After four hours his friends came and took him down.
He had been severely beaten and almost killed.
The Romans had nothing to do with it.
He was done in by the Sadducees and the Pharisees.
It was an internal conflict within the Hebrew world.
He spoke Aramaic.
However,
that was not the language used for the Gospels.
He was healed by three men from India.
The healing took place inside the tomb.
On the third day,
he left the tomb,
gathered up his wife and four sons,
and got out of Jerusalem never to return.
He died in Turkey.
His bloodline really does continue to this day by his four sons.
The bloodline in the real story is known by Israel,
and any one of the bloodline is pulled from tragedy.
The man David took out of California would have died in prison as a pedophile.
David got him to Heathrow.
Everything David told me in the hotel room in the Philippines was true.
I heard the exact same story of Christ from Billy Meier and his people in Switzerland.
It was a lot for a Mormon to take in,
and I was no longer a Mormon when I left Switzerland.


People lose their mind when they find out that the Abrahamic teachings and the prophetic lineage is part of an extraterrestrial communication with the human race on planet earth.
It's unfortunate that they are so close-minded.
I spent a fair bit of time with Billy and the Plejeran group in Switzerland.
It was a beautiful little spot on this planet.
It's like there's a bubble over the whole farm,
a protective bubble.
You can really relax and unwind when you go to Billy's farm in Switzerland.
The Plejerans don't openly interact with all members of the group.
Once you understand that these spiritual teachings,
the Abrahamic teachings,
are related to an extraterrestrial race which by some form of responsibility in our universe has been assigned to us,
the whole concept of extraterrestrials takes on new meaning.
What do the prophets of the Abrahamic teachings mean when they refer to Satan?
If the angelic order is the Plejerans,
then what is the demonic hierarchy?
It's a collective of other races,
negative races.
The human race is now and has been for a long time a proxy war between extraterrestrial races. 


Then who are what are they referring to when they speak about Satan?
The whole thing takes on a new dimension,
multiple new dimensions,
when it becomes extraterrestrial.
Bruce MacDonald and John Edmonds touched upon some of the ideas that are necessary to understand this phenomenon in their book,
Stardust Ranch:
The Incredible True Story.
Extraterrestrials are more evolved forms of sentient life if they have achieved space travel and if they can visit us and interact with us here on planet earth.
What is a more evolved life form?
The first characteristic of a more evolved life form is comprehension of multiple dimensions of reality.
These extraterrestrials can communicate with both the living and the dead.
Their particular form of evolution allows them to connect with both physical life-forms alive on the planet and deceased human beings in the afterlife.
They can also communicate with the living through telepathy,
or by direct consciousness connection.
It's our consciousness that survives death.
The various spiritual teachings on the planet explain this ad nausea.
The human race is not going to have any peace until it realizes that it's a multi-dimensional being.
The idea of a single human life of eighty years and then an eternal darkness or an eternal heaven in death is the most absurd concept in our reality.
It's the cause of a tremendous amount of pain,
ignorance,
and suffering we bring upon ourselves.
However,
it's a normal phase in the growth cycle of a developing species.
Most spiritual teachings on the planet know about the extraterrestrials.
The more evolved teachings definitely do.
I simply do not understand why the human beings on this planet have such a difficult time accepting this.
It's really quite astounding when you realize that the creation myths and most of the native lore tacitly encompass the extraterrestrial phenomenon,
but the modern scientific man can't bridge the two things.


The Plejerans are not gods.
No extraterrestrial race are gods.
They have claimed to be gods.
In fact,
there is no god as it's understood by many of the people on the planet now.
There is no individuated being that we could name that could be called god.
It's a childish fantasy that the human race has not outgrown.
If you look at the record of the Abrahamic teachings,
they are at war with each other.
The Jews hate the Christians,
regarding Christ himself as an apostate to the original Jewish teachings,
or,
more realistically,
shutting down the cash business of the Sadducees and Pharisees through temple taxes.
The Christians don't really get along with the Muslims,
and the Muslims definitely do not like the Jews.
Doesn't sound too much like the work of a perfect people does it?
The Plejerans are just another race in our universe who have tried to help us.
They did the best they could.
Creation itself is the manifestation of what we would call god.
The creator is a non-individuated life force that is conscious.
The god narrative comes from the Plejerans.
It's non-violent energy harvesting,
same as the dark extraterrestrials but different rituals. 
The whole human experience has been an extraterrestrial good cop,
bad cop routine.


The Plejeran spiritual teachings given by Billy Meier in the contact notes go into an incredible amount of detail about how the spirit and the matter work together to create life,
the reincarnation process,
and a whole host of other things that are part of our reality.
Billy did an amazing job.
His presence on the planet and his voice have not always been welcome.
There have been multiple attempts on his life.
When I was in Switzerland there was a two-man post across the valley up on the mountain near his farm that was perpetually maintained by the CIA.
There we are again at the intelligence service.
Interesting isn't it?
The CIA is running the child sex honey pots,
and they are in on the Satanic rituals,
and they also keep a constant watch on Billy Meier.
If we're living in an age of disclosure,
and the government wants knowledge of extraterrestrials out in the public,
as seems to be the case with quasi-government spokespeople like Steven Greer and his Disclosure Project,[^24]
then why all the paranoia about this mild-mannered,
one-armed,
innocuous Swiss farmer?
Why has so much time been put into discrediting Billy Meier?
These are all very important questions if the human race is ready for the disclosure that we are not alone as a life form in this universe.

[^24]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_M._Greer

If the Plejerans are guilty of anything it's not following through.
They give something to the human race,
or racial group within the general human race,
and then they go away.
There's no follow-through,
ongoing tutoring,
or anything that could be called maintenance.
Take the Jesus story for example.
They had a Plejeran holy person,
an ishwish,
mate with a female human.
This produced a human hybrid with alien DNA.
It's an interesting thing to note.
The Christ was the first alien-human hybrid.
In fact he wasn't.
Adam was the first alien-human hybrid.
The entire Adamic line is a Plejeran experiment,
and,
as already stated in this chapter,
when you look at the infighting just among the Abrahamic teachings it's ridiculous.
What the Plejerans will not do is actually come to the planet and take responsibility for their creation at least until such a time as the human race can stand independently.
In cosmic terms it's like a man and a woman having a child and raising it to the age of three years,
when it can walk and talk a little bit,
and then leaving it alone in the woods and saying good luck,
but it gets even darker than that.
The Plejerans are not all light and love.
They don't believe in obligation to us,
even though we are their creation.
They don't want any karmic attachments to us,
and,
just like us
&mdash;
the human race
&mdash;
they are a conflicted and divided people with many factions.


Most of the benign tutoring given to Billy Meier was by a Plejeran named Semjase.
She was a good Plejeran.
She gave excellent messages and excellent counsel to Billy.
The Plejeran order said that she received a head injury and had to leave her mission with Billy and the earth.
That's a highly dubious claim.
The Plejerans have all kinds of ways to read the environment before they land to make themselves aware of danger.
I think it was at that moment,
when Semjase was taken out and replaced with new Plejerans,
that the race themselves decided to walk away from us.
The teachings and the movement that Billy started have turned into a cult,
and they really don't have anything to offer the world,
except the information I have given you here.
They are responsible for the white race,
and this includes Jews,
the red races,
meaning the natives,
and the brown races,
meaning the Arabic tribes.



From the very beginning,
the Plejeran systems of teaching had been invested with a kind of egocentrism that ended up harvesting our energy for their concept of god,
which was really them in the end,
and because we were taught to worship them as god,
the human mimickers,
the rabbis,
priests,
and imams became mini-Plejerans,
becoming doorways to god,
instead of teaching us to experience the non-individuated creator ourselves. 
As you look at the fractals of the Plejeran teachings in the modern Abrahamic traditions,
you see forms of energy harvesting that aggrandize the robed individual,
he or she who is in proximity to god.
It's all a bunch of nonsense.
It's created tremendous havoc and disharmony in the races that have been affected by these so-called spiritual teachings.
And now it's degenerated to child rape and Satanism.
This is the fruit of these teachings.
The Plejerans have done us no favors.


It's my belief that the Plejerans would rather blow up the whole human race than be dragged into the quagmire of karma the human situation has become in the early twenty-first century.
It's a love-hate relationship from the outset.
According to Billy and the teachings,
the Plejeran were assigned to the human race.
There exists a kind of counsel in our galaxy and beyond which affixes mentor races to developing races.
Why that would even have to take place if the Plejerans created us is a mystery to begin with.
This means that the Plejerans become the creation and the destruction.
The contact notes are full of predictions.
It has to be said that Billy's predictions from the 1960s and seventies as they have projected into the twenty-first century are nearly completely accurate.



The foundation of the Abrahamic scriptures is the Plejerans.
They were most of the prophets including the last two,
Yeshua and Muhammad.
I know I'm asking people to believe a lot.
Take all of that angel and demon nonsense and just throw it out the window.
They're all extraterrestrials.
I learned a lot with Billy and I learned a lot from his contact notes,
but I'm sorry to say that I do not believe the Plejerans have our best interests at heart anymore.
When Semjase left and the new team came in,
it was just information withholding and non-assistance to the human race.
The position I saw Billy Meier in when I went to Switzerland was kind of like a compromised intelligence asset.
His handlers were the Plejerans and they completely burned him.
The Plejerans are part of the problem now.
Their *prophecies* were a spiritual fallacy to begin with because god exists in the moment,
but the Plejerans had to aggrandize themselves and show us the future,
which the lowest of human spirits can pretty much see when they're on the other side as well,
so there's no great revelation there,
and now we're locked up in this end game.
Everybody running to *end times*.
You've got the insane Zionists looking for the return of their messiah,
the insane Christians looking for the return of Christ,
and the insane Muslims waiting for the return of the Mahdi.
It's a shit show.
Thank you very much Plejeran mismanagement.


Another narrative you've been hearing a lot in the last few decades,
thanks to people like David Icke,
is this narrative of the reptilian.
It's true,
they do exist.
Oddly enough,
I've never seen a reptilian in my whole life.
I've seen countless other extraterrestrials but never a reptilian.
I guess they just know to stay away from me.
William Tompkins came out in 2017 just before he died and gave a number of interviews related to his book,
Selected by Extraterrestrials:
My life in the Top Secret World of UFOs,
Think-Tanks and Nordic Secretaries.
There are a few things that I need to correct.
Tompkins says that the Nazis made an alignment with the reptilians.
Whether that is true or not I cannot definitively say,
but I am highly doubtful.
It's the kind of pithy saying that is coming out in extraterrestrial literature now.
In essence,
the extraterrestrial narrative has entered into our geopolitics.



By assigning the reptilians to the Nazis we can consolidate the idea that the evil Germans turned on the human race,
but it doesn't make sense.
Why would the reptilians endorse the idea of a *master race*,
and why would their message and purpose be erroneously documented as the destruction of the *chosen people*?
It doesn't add up.
Hitler developed a successful economic model contrary to what was commenced by the English in the century of The Worshipful Fuellers.
By taking the facile narrative of racism we obfuscate the underlying issue,
passive control of the world through the Babylonian money magic.
The kind of racism I see in the Nazi movement is more akin to Plejeran and Nordic extraterrestrial involvement than reptilian.
Hitler was involved with the Thule Society and the Vril society and that they were Plejeran front groups that were channeling information from Semjase,
the same Plejeran initially appointed to mentor Billy Meier.
Remember,
these beings live lives at least ten times longer than a human being.
We're the June bug of lifespans in the universe of sentient hominids.


There's also the very interesting question about the Jews.
The Jews have accepted more than one form of input into their scriptures.
Their scriptures were largely Plejeran to begin with,
but at the time that the United Kingdom of Israel was broken up under King Solomon we see another group in there,
don't we?
We see the black magic group which gave Solomon the ability to control the demons.
We see the Signet ring,
and we see the commencement of the Kabbalah.
The Temple of Solomon practiced sacrifice. 
This ultimately leads to a new school of extraterrestrial teaching,
the school that runs the world now,
the school that consolidated its power and planted the seed for the world system we live in now way back in England during the second half of the seventeenth century,
which gave us the Bank of England,
the speculative masons,
and The Worshipful Fuellers
&mdash;
who financed the rebuilding of London after the fire of 1666
&mdash;
and the private-public partnerships that led to the shit show we see in the world today,
and,
coincidentally,
we find ourselves entertaining the construction of the Third Temple of Solomon under what is quickly becoming,
by territoriality,
the United Kingdom of Israel,
returning us to sacrifice,
which is the basis of blood magic.



The extraterrestrials on this planet are in fact the controllers,
all of them,
including the Plejerans.
The human race is nothing more than an experiment for them.
There's nobody really defending our interests.
The human beings that work with them consciously or unconsciously are weakened venal people who are corrupted.
Everybody is sitting around waiting for an alien takeover.
If you have not yet adduced what Bruce and I are trying to say in this book,
let us be blunt:
this has been a colonized race since its inception.
The variances in governorship and the vicissitudes of this race,
including the misfortune we have brought upon ourselves in wars,
are something that our extraterrestrial *lords* are quite fine with.
Nothing good will come from extraterrestrials coming into the earth and bailing us out of the horrible situation we have gotten ourselves into.
That's what the twentieth century was about,
and it almost destroyed us.
What the world needs now are diligent people who focus on what it means to be human and what the human potential is without any more extraterrestrial interference.
There is no unconditional relationship with the human race.
The Plejerans have so screwed this up with their Abrahamic scriptures and their interference in our development down here and their playing god that we don't have a base language that we all understand.
It is true that there is something called god,
which might be a synonym for life itself,
which loves us unconditionally,
all of us.
This is the gift of life.
This is the love of the creator.
The god crap in the Abrahamic scriptures is the Plejerans pleasing themselves.
It's time we grew up and realized that these extraterrestrials are just us with more technology and mobility and a little bit more dimensional comprehension.
That aside,
they are as flawed as this human race and they have fought and warred with each other in civil wars and warred with other races in the galaxy.


There are too many extraterrestrial races interacting with the human race to even list.
It wasn't always this way.
In the beginning it was a controlled Eden experiment.
Other races came in.
The reptilians have always been here.
They evolved on this planet and they are indigenous to it just as the human form.
It doesn't really matter what race a human form comes from.
The experience in this dense three-dimensional reality we call earth is unique to all of us and we need to unite as a common human race.
We need to preserve our environment for future generations because if we try to blow up this planet the consequences will be enormous.
The truth is we will not be allowed to destroy this planet.
We will be destroyed before the planet is allowed to be destroyed.
This is too rich and too beautiful a planet with its expression of life,
which even the extraterrestrials enjoy and admire,
for it to be decimated by a sentient race on the planet that has not yet learned to control itself.
It will not be allowed to happen.
Negative forces crept into the human consciousness experience and accelerated certain scientific discoveries that have thrown our spiritual and intellectual unfoldment out of balance.
The Plejerans have stated through Billy Meier they will leave earth after Billy passes,
never to return.
