My Early Life
===============

I was born in the early nineteen-sixties in California.
My father was German.
My grandfather came from Germany in circumstances that are still a mystery to me.
I believe it was some kind of progenitor of Project Paperclip[^2].

[^2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip

>Operation Paperclip was a secret program of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) largely carried out by special agents of Army CIC, in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians, such as Wernher von Braun and his V-2 rocket team, were taken from Germany to the United States, for U.S. government employment, primarily between 1945 and 1959. Many were former members, and some were former leaders, of the Nazi Party.

I used to call my grandfather on the phone.
He'd pick up and say,
Hello?
I'd say,
Grandpa,
it's Bobby.
And he'd say,
I hate Hitler!
Seriously,
he did it almost every time I called.
I'd have to say,
I didn't call to talk about Hitler,
and he'd say,
Oh,
what do you need?
Then I'd ask him whatever I'd called to ask. 

My siblings and I weren't told much about our European past.
It was better not talked about.
The only reason I even questioned my German ethnicity before the age of ten was the way my grandfather answered the phone with
*I hate Hitler!*
He made me look into it.
The Nazis never lost the war.
The German people did,
but the Nazis didn't.
They got out in ratlines set up by the Vatican.
That's how they got to South America.
The high command took a secret submarine fleet to Antarctica where they and their descendants live to this day.
True story.
Admiral Bird went down there with some troops to flush them out and they got their asses kicked.
The Nazis had foo fighters in Antarctica in the late forties.
Have you ever heard that in your history courses,
or on your mainstream media,
except maybe in the context of some cheesy History Channel UFO program?
No,
you haven't.
See what I mean about the bullshit context you've been given?
And that's just since the Second World War,
the last seventy-five years.
The bad context goes back to Christ,
the Romans,
the Sanhedrin,
and thousands of years before that even,
but I don't want to overwhelm or depress you in the opening chapters.



My grandfather was a very smart man,
a rocket scientist.
He worked with the Nazi Party.
You couldn't be smart in Germany back then and not work with the Nazi Party.
I don't know exactly what my grandfather did,
but it was enough to get him out of Germany and into the United States.
He left before the war started.
I think he came over in 1933.
I make the *Paperclip* analogy because he was an intelligence extraction by the United States.
Thank god for that,
otherwise my family might have drawn the Russian lot after World War II.
I don't even want to think about growing up in Russia.

My father was a Master Chief in the US Navy.
He was highly respected. 
Even though he wasn't a commissioned officer,
he associated with a lot of four star brass in the Navy.
I didn't know my father well.
He left my mother,
my brother,
who is two years older than me,
and my sister,
who is two years younger than me,
when I was six years old.
He bought a house for us in Bell Gardens,
a coastal suburb of Los Angeles.
It was a cheap house in a run-down part of Los Angeles.
My father was a cheapskate.
He stiffed us on a good home to start out in,
and he saved his money for booze and broads.
He also broke my mother's heart.

It was rough for us growing up.
We didn't have a lot of money.
I was hungry a lot of the time.
I wore hand-me-down clothes.
The divorce broke my mother.
She was caught up in her sadness.
We kids were left to our own.
I remember walking around Bell Gardens at midnight many nights when I was seven years old.
My mother was out a lot.
There was no adult supervision.
I would just wander the streets at night.
It was scary and exhilarating. 
I once had a knife put to my throat,
and I was cut,
but not deeply enough to kill me.
Some of my neighbors heard my scream and came out.
The guy with the knife ran away.
I didn't have any money,
so he didn't want to rob me.
He didn't drag me into an alley to rape me,
so he wasn't a pedophile.
He just wanted to slit a seven year old kid's throat just to do it.
I had my first near death experience that night.
My spirit left my body.
Bell Gardens was spooky.


Because I was white and I had a German surname,
I was picked on a lot by the Latinos in my neighborhood and at school.
They called me *kraut*.
Getting picked on makes you tough.
Nobody is born tough.
It's a response to environment.
I had to get tough or I would have been destroyed.


My brother found a different path in life.
He inherited the genius of my grandfather.
School was very easy for him.
He was recognized as a very bright individual from a young age.
He's gone on to become a multi-millionaire in the world of network engineering.
My sister has lived a normal and quiet family life.
I'm the only one who bought a ticket to hell,
the middle kid.


My mother was a Mormon,
so I was raised Mormon.
Her people go right back to the first congregants around John Smith and Brigham Young.
They moved across the east coast in wagons and settled in Colorado, 
settling in Manassa,
Conejos County as directed by LDS leaders.  
In the early years of Mormonism Polygamy was practiced.  
My mother's hometown was one of several used by LDS leaders to hide Mormons who were polygamists.  
If her line had polygamy it's not spoken of, 
since it was illegal then.   
It was reserved for the hierarchy  
When Washington agents went to Salt Lake City to bust them,
the men would get wind of it and leave for Colorado,
where Mormon brethren gave them shelter and sustenance.
It was real tough to catch these guys.
The women and children stayed in Salt Lake City.
My mother grew up with these absences of her father,
my grandfather,
when he had to flee the federal law or face polygamy charges.
Sometimes my mother and grandmother would get to go and see him in Colorado,
but most of the time they waited however long it took for the threat of arrest to abate.
Mormons believe they have the right to multi-wife families,
or they did back then. 
The government sure wasn't okay with polygamy.
The way my mother described it to me when I was a kid reminded me of the road runner and coyote cartoons,
with my grandfather as the smart road runner and the federal agents as the sneaky coyote.


I was always fascinated with religion.
Because Mormonism was the only religion I knew when I was young,
I was fascinated with Mormonism.
I spent a lot of time studying *The Book of Mormon*.
I mean I read that thing over and over,
the way other kids read comic books.
I read all the books I could find on Mormonism.
I went to temple a lot.
I went by myself.
My mother didn't take us.
I think she lost her faith after my dad left,
that or sorrow wouldn't let her be religious.
I don't know.
We didn't have deep conversations,
my mother and I.

It was odd that I found my place in that religion.
I guess I just needed something in which to believe.
My father had left us.
My mother had left us emotionally and retreated into a world of sadness.
My brother did his thing.
My sister coped as she could. 
I went to Mormon Temple. 
I came to understand Jesus Christ as the Mormons did,
the literal son of god,
resurrected from death,
and the fulfillment of a blood offering by god himself,
an offering that healed the world.
I don't believe it anymore,
but I'm not going to disrespect anyone else's belief.
It helped me a lot when I needed it.
That's all that's important
&mdash;
the imagination becoming real to make the unbearable bearable. 


I was always attuned to the spirit world.
I could see things other people couldn't see, 
things around people,
people in graveyards,
shadowy figures who I knew were not of the world.
I was like that kid from the movie,
*The Sixth Sense*.
I was born with this attuning. 
There was no inciting incident,
nothing that brought it on,
at least not that I knew about.
I was scared a lot because of the place we lived,
Bell Gardens.
It had a creepy vibe.
I didn't know it when I was a child,
but it was a big center for magical culture,
Spanish-Catholic subcultures like Santeria and Palo Mayombe.
My only context for my second sight,
my attuning to the world of spirits,
was Mormonism,
so I thought there was an evil to it.
I learned to keep my knowledge of the spirit world to myself.
There was no good outcome when I opened my mouth.
My mother didn't know what to make of what I told her.

I can't remember exactly how old I was when I started seeing the people.
They weren't living.
I knew that much.
I guess I was around ten years old.
Figures would appear in my home.
They very often wore dark suits and dark hats,
fedoras.
I know that sounds strange.
It's a little like the Men in Black you hear about in the extraterrestrial circles,
but,
as long as I can remember,
I've been seeing those people.
Later on in my life,
I would meet them in the formal context through which they interact with the human race at the top power circles,
but,
as a child,
they were like figures walking through my home that only I could see.



Revisiting all this in my story,
my early childhood in Bell Gardens,
the religion my mother gave me,
and the things I saw,
I can see religion gives us false answers.
It packages our experiences for us.
If you see a shadowy being and you're Christian then the being is demonic.
What I learned as I matured was that psychic and spiritual experiences should be looked at objectively.
We need to be more stoic about these things,
like Marcus Aurelius
&mdash;
*This thing, 
what is it in itself, 
in its own constitution? 
What is its substance and material?*[^3]

My father never abandoned us.
He lived close by,
and he stayed in our lives,
though he did deploy with the Navy quite a bit.
I used to visit him when he wasn't deployed.
It involved walking down a train track for a few miles.
Like all movement in that crappy Bell Gardens neighborhood in the late sixties,
it was dangerous.
I could get beat up or robbed.
It didn't matter I was only seven years old.


I had as a child one political foreshadowing of how utterly controlled the world was,
the moon landing.
I watched the film of Neil Armstrong on the moon with my brother in the living room of my house,
and I saw the flag flutter.
I turned to my brother and said,
Is there air on the moon?
He said he didn't know.
It was interesting that I noted it.
My father came by to visit us a week before the moon landing.
He gave me a black and white Hasselblad camera photo of Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon.
I asked him who took the photo,
but he couldn't say.
He had the photo before the astronauts returned with their dramatic ocean splashdown in the capsule.
How could that be?
There wasn't any way to transfer the film from the moon,
no computer faxes or digital transfers
&mdash;
how could that be my child's mind asked again and again.
Later on in life I found out.
The truth of the moon story is that we really did go,
but the film is fake.
It was shot in a studio by the great film maker,
Stanley Kubrick.
We had *non-human* help getting to the moon.
No human civilization on the planet can get to the moon without help.
We will get more into that in future chapters.
If you frequent conspiracy circles,
you've heard the story about Stanley Kubrick doing the moon landing film in a studio.
Some people think Kubrick was an outsider who looked into the world that runs the world and spoke about it his whole life through his films.
I agree that all of his films have something to tell about the inner workings of the people who run the world,
but I'm not quite sure Stanley was an outsider.
He met his wife at a ritual.
