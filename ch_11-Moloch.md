Moloch 
=========================




The only good thing that came out of the Philippines was meeting David.
The way things got set up over there,
he and I shared a room.
Kane was in the main suite we all used as an office.
The first thing that David and I did was take a run and a swim together.
That's the way soldiers roll,
especially people who've been through special forces training.
You test each other.
You would never see David coming in a million years.
He was only five feet and ten inches tall,
and he was very wiry,
which,
when I think about it,
is a way of saying that he had highly developed tendons and core muscle without muscle fat or bulk.
He was a machine.
We did a flat-out sprint on the beach for about three miles.
He called the run,
not me,
but I was pretty wiped out after the three miles.
Next came the water,
in which I had a distinct advantage being a graduate of Navy Special Warfare.
We went into the ocean and started swimming out.
About every five hundred meters I looked behind me to see if he was still there.
I was swimming fast.
He managed to keep up.
We went about a mile and a half out before he called the swim.
I could have gone out three miles easy.
After the run and the swim we respected each other.
We're simple creatures,
elite operators,
kind of like making a new friend in a school playground.




I've always liked soldiers.
We don't lie to each other,
especially when we're thrown into a hotel suite with a bunch of spooks and whatever the hell Kane was.
The first thing real operators do when scoping out an operation is get their own intelligence.
You can't trust anything you get from an intelligence source.
In the special forces we do all our own reconnaissance before we execute a mission.
The number one rule is you can't trust intelligence you don't get yourself.
Operating from that rule,
soldiers like David and I share intelligence.
We understand it's our well being if the intelligence is flawed,
not the spook desk jockey who fronted the intelligence.


David had never worked with Kane before the trip to the Philippines either.
He'd done all kinds of contract work for the CIA,
MI6,
Mossad,
and other intelligence agencies and national entities,
but not Kane,
so he was curious,
cautious,
and observant,
same as me.
David had an excellent reputation as an independent operator.
You have to get your mind around the kind of guy I'm trying to describe here.
If you've ever seen the television show,
Ray Donovan,
you understand the concept of a fixer.
In the series,
Ray Donovan is a fixer for Hollywood elites and lawyers.
He gets rid of bodies when a prostitute overdoses in a famous athlete's hotel room,
things like this.
Now ask yourself this
&mdash;
what in the world would an intelligence agency or a national government need a fixer for?
They have their own operators.
Why go to a freelancer?
I'll leave that to your imagination.
Some things are better understood if you apply a little imagination to them.



I will tell you a story David shared with me.
He was contracted by the Mossad to get a man out of Los Angeles,
an American citizen.
David lived in the United States when I met him,
even though he was born in the United Kingdom and trained by the British SAS,
so he was a go-to guy in the US contracting market.
The man in Los Angeles had his passport taken by court order.
He was on bail and up on multiple charges of sexual interference with a minor.
The case against him was overwhelming.
The best he could hope for was a good plea bargain,
but he was definitely going to prison.
It was highly likely that this person would be killed in prison.
Child molesters don't do well in maximum-security prisons.
This guy was a bookish five feet and five inches tall,
and Jewish.
He held some importance for the Mossad,
despite the fact that he was not active in Israeli lobbying in the United States,
or a highly moneyed person,
or anything else that would easily define his value to Israel and the Mossad,
but they didn't want this guy going to prison.


David hadn't been told the details of the charges against the guy.
He only knew he was picking up a Jewish guy in Los Angeles and getting him to London and out of Heathrow Airport without a passport,
and he'd been promised one million US dollars for the job.
That wasn't just good money for the evacuation of one civilian from a nation state where he had his passport removed
&mdash;
it was ludicrous money.
It set off a lot of alarm bells in David.
In the profession David had chosen,
the profession I was considering for three weeks in the Philippines hotel room,
asking unnecessary questions is stupid.
It's a point specific,
see no evil,
hear no evil profession.
The money told David the level of scrutiny and caution he should bring to the task.
David was assured there would be no tactical resistance to removing the man from the country,
and this meant there were no kill squads looking for the man,
no open contracts on his life.
David had been told that the only real criteria for the job was the ability to get the man past two sets of customs and immigration departments,
the first in Los Angeles,
and the second at Heathrow Airport in London,
England.
David was tasked because he had the contacts in both Los Angeles and London to get it done.
He knew who to pay off to get on a plane in Los Angeles and through customs at Heathrow Airport without a passport.
Once David walked the man out of Heathrow,
he was the Mossad's problem.
One million US dollars for that simple piece of work.
It seemed to good to be true.


The problem was the guy started talking to David.
A lot of these creepy types are unashamed of their behavior.
He started talking about his sexual exploits with five year old boys,
the way a heterosexual man might talk about the juicy details of a woman he picked up in a bar.
It was all David could do not to kill the guy on the spot.
He was going to drop the contract altogether,
which is something you don't do midway through an intelligence operation like this,
but David wouldn't have taken the job,
even for the million dollars,
had he known the guy was a serial pedophile.
Everybody has their limit.
Raping kids was David's.
He called the contract broker,
a Mossad agent out of Toronto,
and told him he was going to drop the asset in front of LAX Airport.
What David heard from the Mossad man in Toronto changed his mind.
He got them both on the plane in Los Angeles and through Heathrow in England.

This is what the Mossad contract broker in Toronto told David.
The first thing I want to say is that I'm not telling this story for its shock value.
I wouldn't tell this story if I didn't think it had a purpose in my life story.
I've heard this story twice now,
once from David,
and once from the Plejeran group in Switzerland under Billy Meier,
so here goes.
The guy David got out of Los Angeles was a direct descendant of the man we call Jesus Christ.
The Mossad are aware of the bloodline and protect it and extract it from tragedy.
When this man was charged in Los Angeles,
they had to snatch him from tragedy or he would have been killed in prison.
The story David was told,
which is the story he subsequently told me,
is that the man we call Jesus Christ was married and had four sons.
He was not crucified by the Romans.
He was nailed to a y shaped tree.
He was stabbed,
and he did suffer tremendously,
but he was taken down from the tree and placed in a rich man's tomb.
Inside the tomb he was treated by three healers from India.
When he was able to move after three days,
he gathered up his wife and his four sons and he got out of Jerusalem,
and his bloodline,
through his four sons,
is scattered across the planet.


I'm not a theologian or a historian.
I don't know how the story I was told morphed into the Gospels,
the Roman Catholic Church,
the Eastern Orthodox Church,
the Greek Orthodox Church,
and all the other theological fiefdoms that have built nations and empires around them,
up to and including the empire we live in now,
which is the empire of the King James Bible and the Kabbalah,
and remember the most important point I can continually stress in my story,
what was done in small groups in the past is being done institutionally and in our names in the modern world.
The left hand path,
the magical rather than the spiritual path,
the enslavement rather than the liberation path,
started with the King James Bible,
which gave the authority to rule,
and which led to The Bank of England.
The many variations on this Hebrew man's story have been used to control and tax people for indulgences for two thousand years.
It's a shit show.


This was the quality of soldiers that I like.
The story David shared with me was a perfect story.
He knew exactly what its effect would be upon me,
that's why he told me the story.
You can't hear a story like that from a credible source,
and for me David was a credible source
&mdash;
and I subsequently met the Mossad hiring agent in Toronto Canada
&mdash;
and not be affected by it.
It haunted me.
It took my whole life in a new direction,
one that wouldn't fully manifest for another five or six years.
Remember,
I was raised Mormon,
and at the time I found myself in the hotel suite in the Philippines,
I would still identify as Mormon if asked to name my religion on any kind of form.
I was heavily invested in the Christ story as it had been told by modern Christian religions.
David shared with me one of the most important pieces of intelligence he'd come across in his life.
That's what soldiers do.
They share intelligence.
We take the same risks.
We obey the same chains of command,
whether in the public or the private sector,
and in that shared burden,
that common guild,
we share with each other important information.


I'm grateful David told me that story.
I wasn't at the time.
When I first heard that story,
when we were both off duty from the main hotel suite with Kane and his crew of creeps,
when David and I were beginning to form our bond,
realizing we'd been interviewed and failed because we balked at setting up an orphanage for the Vatican,
when we shared our disgust for the people we had to cohabit with in that hotel suite,
I was devastated.
But over time I became grateful David shared that sterling piece of intelligence with me.
I'm now sharing it with you.



No human being who has ever walked this earth has created more controversy and more strife than Jesus Christ.
Everywhere the ideological Christ has gone blood has been spilled.
In his name they gave themselves legal authority to reap and pillage.
Jesus Christ was their license.
If we take the story David told me as true,
we have to ask ourselves who wrote the Gospels?
Why were the real Gospels redone by tyrants and madmen to overlay the story of the resurrection,
the eternal life through his name?
Why was the pagan sun worship woven into the story?
It's the most successful scam in the history of scams on this planet.
Yet the man really existed.
And he was charged with a divine mission.
I'm sure some of what we call the Christ persists in the Gospels,
and I'm sure that he was regarded as a revolutionary in his time.
But the cultivation of the son of god and eternal salvation through his sacrifice is entirely a social construct created by men far less then the true man of the Gospels,
and created with the sole intention of exploiting people.
Again,
I feel the need to say,
I'm not trying to offend anybody,
especially now,
especially when people are looking to their religion for comfort,
but maybe it isn't comfort you should be looking for right now.
Maybe you should be looking deeper,
inside of your pain,
and trying to find some real answers to your own existence.
The stakes have never been higher.
Why perish in a lie?


We should also take a moment to discuss some of the things that were touched upon in the last chapter because they're pretty shocking.
I told you that a fax came in from the Vatican.
They wanted an orphanage set up.
What that meant is they wanted a steady supply of children.
The Vatican is part of the Satanic-Luciferian structure.
If you don't know that yet,
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you,
especially if you still find yourself heavily invested in their salvation doctrine.
Mother Theresa,
the phony saint of Calcutta,
was a child trafficker.
Nobody was counting orphans in India back then.
Everybody is in on the child sacrifice now.
All the major religions from the Abrahamic roots are doing it,
including my birth religion of Mormonism.
There has been a lot of push back on this.
It raised its head in the United States in 2016 with the Pizzagate scandal.
The mainstream media mocked Pizzagate.
There was the fellow who went down to Comet Pizza with a firearm.
He was arrested before he could do any harm but they were quick to make a poster boy out of him for the crazy surrounding Pizzagate.
YouTube started taking down all of the informational documentaries about the subject.
The people's media has never been the people's media.


There exists within the world three city-states unlike any other:
the Vatican,
London City,
and Washington District of Columbia.
All three of these entities stand on equal footing with the nations of the world.
Washington is not the capital of the United States.
It is a separate country within the United States.
It's not recognized as a country at the United Nations,
but within the corporate structure of nations that we discussed earlier,
it's a unique corporate structure.
The same is true of the Vatican and its relationship with the nation host of Italy and London City within the nation host of England.
These are the three power centers in the world.
You could say they are the visible power structures if you wanted to be a stickler.
There are of course invisible power centers.
Bruce covered this quite well in his book,
Stardust Ranch:
The Incredible True Story.
These ranches like Stardust,
and Bradshaw,
and Skinwalker are all nodal points to at least one other dimension.
A nodal point is an energy center.
On the physical body they are known as the chakras.
The earth has them as well.
When you hear occult phrases like,
as above so below,
you need to realize what they truly mean.
The construction of our reality is built upon certain constants which vary in scale from the microcosm to the macrocosm.
This is why the advanced yogis in India say that an individual human body and the consciousness therein is a replication of the entire universe.
This is why a human life is so important.
It allows us to focus and direct the energies of consciousness through the body.
When we are alive we can encompass all of creation because part of creation is physical as well.
When we are dead and in the next dimension waiting reincarnation,
we are missing part of the whole.
If while we were alive we connected to the holy spirit,
divine love,
or source energy as some call it,
then that connection will pull us back to creation once we let go of the body,
though we might spend some time in a dimension below the creator's pure expression to dispel attachments there,
emotional,
nostalgic,
or mental.
If we didn't connect with the primary energy we're going to be coming back to physical creation.
I don't want to start a big fight with theologians and academics and students of comparative religion,
so let's just say this is my cosmology and leave it at that.


Even if you disagree with me,
it won't impede your reading and understanding of the rest of this story.
The information I'm going to give you about the magic and the ritual practice is not up for debate.
I've done magical rituals myself.
They will be discussed in the Palo Mayombe chapter.
It's hard to tell this story.
It really didn't all come together until a few years ago,
but in telling this story I have to go back in my life and apply the consciousness I have now to the situations I lived through without the awareness at the time.
It's a little bit of a falsity,
but narrative conceit is part of writing,
and in the end I'm telling you the truth.
It's just that the timeline is hard to get into a nicely packaged story unless we were writing fiction.

The child sacrifice falls under the umbrella of Moloch.
This is one of the three chief demons that John Milton poeticized in *Paradise Lost*.
He has an ancient history in the Abrahamic scriptures,
and he appears under other names in ancient times.
The ancient Israelites were no doubt involved in Moloch worship.
The common practice was to put a live baby into a bronze statue of a bull.
The belly had been carved out and a fire was made in the bottom of the statue to heat up the hollowed-out belly.
The child would be placed in and would slowly die from the scalding bronze heated up by the fire.
The death was not quick.
To drown out the screaming of the infant,
bells were set about on strings.
Whenever there was a child being sacrificed the screams were muted by the jingling of bells.
If you made the connection to the modern Christmas ritual you're correct.
Santa Claus is an effigy of Moloch.
People put their children on his knee,
and we must remember that most of his relationship is with children,
and he wears a red suit,
and he is accompanied by the jingling of bells.
So many of the rituals in modern Christianity are effigies for older Satanic-Luciferian rituals.
They love to mock.


What most of the people involved in this Satanic-Luciferian culture don't know is that it doesn't exist.
Remember,
context is everything.
The participants think they're involved in a religious subculture worshiping dark demons.
The truth is they're involved with extraterrestrials in commerce.
There is an entire economy around human energy and the component parts of the human body.
It's an occulted economy.
It's grown quite large in the last seventy-five years.
There's something about the Second World War and what the Nazis got into and the ensuing pursuits of both the KGB and the CIA that have brought us to the ridiculous point we are at now.
The occult economy is enormous now.
That's why the emphasis has shifted to controlling production.
That's why the Vatican sets up its orphanages all over the world,
so they can take children that won't be missed and won't be counted at any family table.
It's part of the fundamental deception that we live in that the people masquerading as the ones we can most trust are the ones we can least trust.
The goal of the Satanic-Luciferian system is to create a complete and total inversion of everything we think.
Christmas is an excellent example.
In our conscious minds we think it's a celebration of selflessness through the birth of Christ.
In reality the word Santa is an anagram for Satan and the entire ritual is a conjuring of the Moloch spirit.
It's the presence of the other side.

Moloch is a dysphemism.
It's a deliberately dark and derogatory way of talking about a kind of commerce.
That presence is extraterrestrial.
It's always been an extraterrestrial story.
There is a spiritual realm close to the physical earth in which human beings reside.
These poor souls were unable to go to any of the inner worlds.
They had no way of moving on the other side.
A human life is about building a spiritual energy so you have momentum on the other side.
So many people are dying now and just hanging around close to the earth.
This is where a lot of people get voices in their heads.
It's a spirit.
The extraterrestrials control this dimension of disincarnate human beings.
In that regard they might be considered the head demons in CS Lewis's *Screw-tape Letters*.
The human spirits are also used by lower-level black magicians unaffiliated with the global control structure.
The extraterrestrial exchange is run by the power brokers because they're the ones that can bring the big blood.
It is difficult to contemplate these things.
It's not difficult for me.
I'm a soldier.
I've seen things most people don't see.
Blood is a normal part of life for me.
It's difficult to tell this part of my story because I know how it's going to impact people who don't understand blood culture.
You're going to feel uneasy.
You might even feel nauseous.
I'm sorry to be the bringer of these feelings.
We are far past the time where people can pretend this is not going on anymore.
These things must be said out loud.


Let's go back to England, 
because that's the starting point for institutional Satanic culture according to the thesis that Bruce and I are putting forward.
The Egyptian homage permeates London.
The golden mile going out from the River Thames (Isis) has a whole series of monuments and symbols detailing an old world many who work, 
visit,
and live in London don't understand,
as does Vatican City and Washington,
District of Columbia. 
The design of the *power center* cities is occulted from all but the initiates,
their monuments based on precise number sets often using the co-ordinates of Egypt.


For a recent example,
the monument to Lady Diana,
*Lady Di* as she was cursed
&mdash;
die lady,
an intentional curse to which she eventually succumbed
&mdash;
is known as *Isis*.
It is a water monument in her honor. 
The water is bidirectional,
flowing both up and down.
It's made in the image of the eye of Horus. 
The words,
hours and horizon are derived from Horus,
as is the word whore. 
Horus is associated with time,
another thing the English dominate in the world alongside language,
with Greenwich Mean time (GMT) being the zero point for Time. 
The pathway to the *Isis* monument for Princess Diana is the Ibis bird taking you to the underworld. 
In the Egyptian quarter of the basement of Harrods department store,
the basement being a metaphor for the underworld,
there is a dedication to Dodi Fayed and Princess Diana.
Oxford is built on old world knowledge and references it everywhere.
Before we segue into the gods of the Canaanites and the Carthaginians, 
I will take a moment to point out that at the root of Egyptian religious mystery was human sacrifice.


Oxford is the cradle of the modern desire to rule the world.
The word Oxford itself has an interesting etymology.
An ox ford is a place where oxen cross a river,
a ford being a shallow part of a river where you can drive or walk across.
The fords were very well known in the past by people who moved cattle across land.
Now everything is done by train or another modern means of transportation.
If you go to the railway station in Oxford there are a couple of oxen statues.
The ox is a symbol of Moloch,
one of the two forms Moloch can assume in the world,
the other being an owl.
Oxford is also derived from Osiris.
The temporary name for the River Thames is the River Isis during the summer semester,
also called the trinity semester at the university.
The connections between Oxford and the ancient world in naming and symbolism are everywhere once you tune into it,
and Egypt factors in as well.
Isis was the sister and wife of Osiris and the mother of Horus.
Isis is associated with the underworld.





So who is Moloch?
No need to reinvent the wheel.
Here is what the Encyclopedia Britannica says.[^17]

[^17]: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Moloch-ancient-god


>Moloch, also spelled Molech, a Canaanite deity associated in biblical sources with the practice of child sacrifice. The name derives from combining the 
consonants of the Hebrew melech (“king”) with the vowels of boshet (“shame”), the latter often being used in the Old Testament as a variant name for the 
popular god Baal (“Lord”).



>In the Hebrew Bible, Moloch is presented as a foreign deity who was at times illegitimately given a place in Israel’s worship as a result of the 
syncretistic policies of certain apostate kings. The laws given to Moses by god expressly forbade the Jews to do what was done in Egypt or in Canaan. “You 
shall not give any of your children to devote them by fire to Moloch, and so profane the name of your god” (Leviticus 18: 21). Yet kings such as Ahaz (2 
Kings 16: 3) and Manasseh (2 Kings 21: 6), having been influenced by the Assyrians, are reported to have worshiped Moloch at the hilled site of Topheth, 
outside the walls of Jerusalem. This site flourished under Manasseh’s son King Amon but was destroyed during the reign of Josiah, the reformer. “And he 
defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the sons of Hinnom, that no one might burn his son or his daughter as an offering to Moloch” (2 Kings 23:10).

Moloch is associated with child sacrifice,
and very often the sacrifice is made by the parents of the child as you look deeper into the history.
This is not a metaphorical god
&mdash;
now a demon in the Christian cannon
&mdash;
child sacrifice really did go on in the near ancient past,
and the bronze ox was where the child was burned alive.
Artifacts have been uncovered testifying to the reality of Moloch worship.
John Milton,
provides one of the best descriptions of Moloch in his epic poem,
*Paradise Lost*,
portraying Moloch as a the fiercest of the fallen angels,
the most bloodthirsty and craving child sacrifice.
Here is his entrance into Milton's epic work of free verse:




>First Moloch, horrid King besmear'd with blood\
>Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,\
>Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud\
>Thir childrens cries unheard, that past through fire\
>To his grim Idol. Him the Ammonite\
>Worshipt in Rabba and her watry Plain,\
>In Argob and in Basan, to the stream\
>Of utmost Arnon. Not content with such\
>Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart\
>Of Solomon he led by fraud to build\
>His Temple right against the Temple of god\
>On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove\
>The pleasant Vally of Hinnom, Tophet thence\
>And black Gehenna call'd, the Type of Hell.


So what is Oxford University's connection to Moloch?
The first and most obvious is that it's a place where parents send their children.
In the minds of their parents this is for enrichment,
future prosperity,
and status,
essentially all the things for which the ancient parents sacrificed a child,
but there is no sacrifice,
at least not physical,
at least not that we know about.
It is the sacrifice of the imagination,
which is the pathway to the soul.



The curious thing about all of this is that if you were to ask most people to sum up Oxford,
England in one word,
most people might use a word like rational,
as it's the first university in the world,
and it has contributed significantly at a pioneering level to the growth of the industrial and technical revolutions,
as well as championed the classical education,
the man of letters,
if you will.
TS Eliot was awarded a scholarship to Merton College,
Oxford in 1914.
Eliot is considered one of the founders of the *modernist* movement in literature,
with his poem,
*The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock*,
considered a modernist masterpiece.
Like so many who attend Oxford,
Eliot was not a native Briton.
He was born in Missouri.
Despite the fact that we live in a seemingly American global structure culturally,
politically,
and economically,
England,
and specifically Oxford with its Rhodes Scholarship,
has steadily molded many of the cultural,
economic,
and political minds of the world.
Bill Clinton is a good example of a post Cold War leader influenced by his time at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar,
serial rapist that he is.
The American Ivy League universities are modeled on Oxford.
It is the as-of-yet unbroken mold for Western civilization,
which,
even as we hobble into global chaos of seemingly Biblical proportions,
the west still holds the reigns of power,
if only for the sake of the institutions like Oxford which created all modern systems of exchange and commerce.


So what do I mean when I talk about institutional occultism?
Every occult ritual is a form of commerce,
a form of exchange.
The occult folds into the laws of economy.
The fundamentals of economy are spiritual.
This is another thing that has been occulted from us.
We think the economy is just the money we have in our pockets,
our bank accounts,
and retirement plans.
No,
the economy is every exchange in creation for mutual survival,
including exchanges of thought and feeling.
The act of reading this book brings you into economy with me.
A pilot fish cleaning the teeth of a shark is economy.
It's symbiosis.
Economy is more easily explained through biology and the occult practices than it is through Wall Street,
Fleet Street,
or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.


There is no way to overstate the degree to which money has corrupted our idea of what economy is.
The rituals which have come to dominate the world are a part of this economy.
If money is the ability to manifest anything you want,
as we spoke about in the *Mammon* chapter of this book,
then what could be gained from the child sacrifice?
It's the presence of the other,
the commingling of human consciousness with these other beings and entities.
It's a kind of a high,
like a drug.
The beings and entities also give certain assurances.
They can navigate circumstances in the favor of the ritual supplicant,
provide prescience
&mdash;
the ability to know the future
&mdash;
and offer protection.

Now for the final dimension.
This story I am telling you,
my story,
is not a primer on backyard black magic like voodoo or Santeria. 
This story is about institutional Satanism.
So here it is.
It all comes down to intention.
If you build an alter to your spirits on the other side,
and you keep a candle lit for them at all times,
and you sacrifice a chicken for them,
then you have fulfilled the rules of exchange. 
By the laws of economy they must exchange with you.
Why?
Because they want that exchange to continue.
They want what you have offered,
therefore they must deliver what you want.
If you kill a chicken to feed your family,
the offering is within creational law,
meaning the chicken's sacrifice is recognized by the creational process and the creator,
and there is a reward for the sacrifice,
a spiritual boost in the chain of being,
the final form on this planet being the human form,
where you're given all the tools you need to slip the net of cause and effect and free yourself from this world.
It's that simple.
We've been told a hundred times by a hundred different spiritual teachers who have incarnated on our plant to try and help us,
but we don't seem to be able to get it. 
The chicken killed on the black magic alter is killed for the spirits on the other side,
the body left to bleed out on the alter.
The spirits,
although non-physical,
are able to get an energy exchange from the sacrifice,
and they are very grateful. 
That's how the whole thing works.
Now,
what do you think happens when our religious institutions,
our governmental structures,
our international bodies,
and our intelligence agencies,
are really fronts for ritual sacrifice on an industrial scale?
Welcome to the world you're living within.

The use of depleted uranium munitions in Fallujah,
Iraq has killed numerous children and mutated countless others.
The ritual of Moloch as proscribed by the ancient adherents was called *passing through the fire*.
The Moloch rituals are the most vile because they involve an intense and prolonged amount of torture and unimaginable pain for the child.
The attack on the unborn children in Iraq is an *institutional* example of Moloch worship.
It just gets worse from there.
I could give countless examples,
but you get the point,
and Bruce and I don't want to write an unreadable book for its grotesquery. 
The specific dates upon which large sacrifices are made are calculated for maximum efficiency through astrology,
numerology,
geomancy
and gematria,
the stock and trade of Kabbalists and their Masonic brethren. 


It's hard to imagine what could bring a person to human sacrifice.
It's hard to imagine what religious decree could make a person copacetic with taking another human life,
especially a child's.
Yet it goes on.
It goes on at a frequency that would alarm people.
It goes on in circles and among people who might be the last people you would expect to be doing this.
The chief characteristic of the dark rituals is rage.
The practitioners are consumed by a lack of control and to reassert their control or the perception of control they take life.
It's the ultimate commitment to a lost spiritual thread in an individual life.
The dark side can deliver none of the benefits the soul needs to find its true home.


I want you to try to imagine living in a reality that spans multiple spheres or dimensions of expression.
There are too many to count.
Each of those spheres represents an aspect of our reality.
We therefore must ask ourselves what is a reality?
A reality is a chain of constants which allow a being to believe they are living in stability.
Let's take our planet and our physical reality as the baseline.
Everyday the sun rises and sets.
The constellations remain the same at night time.
The elemental structure of air,
earth,
water,
and fire remain constant and build most of the material in this domain.
The force of gravity remains constant and our weight is affixed to the ground.
We don't float away.
Everyone we know who is born will die.
Our parents pass before us.
Our children are born after us.
The generations continue.
Species come and go.
We know the dinosaurs were on the earth because of the fossil record,
but they are no longer here because we don't bump into them when we're hiking in the woods.
Our bodies are susceptible to certain illnesses,
which have been documented by our medical systems.
All of these things form our reality.
They are constant.
They are a small list of the constants that make this physical reality apprehendable to us.
For the most part human consciousness is limited to what the five senses can take in and what the mind can process.
Our senses and our mind appear to have been created to interact with this reality,
therefore we do not feel alien.
We feel as though we belong.
When we look at the other mammal life on the planet we can see that like us they have two eyes,
two nostrils,
a nose,
and two ears.

Nonetheless,
we can see in the other mammalian life-forms a consistency to the life pattern on this planet.
To come into this reality you need a body.
The natural system births new forms of life through women.
It takes a man and a woman to produce a baby.
It's the same for the other mammalian life around us,
cats and dogs and everything in the wild.
All of these things form the constants that define a reality.



It is the same for all other realities.
When you go and investigate the negative dimensions,
what some might call the hell dimensions,
there are constants that maintain those spheres of reality.
There are regions that are kind of like waiting stations.
I hesitate to use the word purgatory because it's so charged with the religions that support it.
These other dimensions have certain constants.
Some are quite dark.
The light that is there is difficult to define.
The only word I can think of is phosphorescent.
It just seems to exist around certain living things,
although even the word living might be misused.
Beings exist in these realms but to say that they live compared to what we call life here in our world might be a bit of a misnomer.
Some of these dimensions exist in context to the earth.
This means that if the earth didn't exist they would not exist.
And in between realms are worlds there can be little buffers as well.
There's a buffer space between the physical world and the lower astral plane.
People who get caught in this place end up living a non-physical existence alongside humanity.
They create a lot of problems for us.
Most if not all of the people that we define medically as schizophrenic are occupied by disembodied beings in this buffer zone.
There are operating groups and there is a social system just like on earth.


When you understand this,
you also understand how misguided the human race is.
It's a strange affectation of our times that as our technology and our sciences appear to grow our comprehension of the spiritual worlds diminishes.
It's hard to imagine living in a world where the medical sciences do not understand what I'm describing.
I can assure you that any psychiatrist working in a lock down facility for twenty years or more would have experiences with schizophrenic people in which they were told things it would be impossible for the afflicted to know unless they were communicating with a disembodied entity.
They brush these experiences aside and continue on with the allopathic treatment for this mental disease,
which is a perpetual paycheck for the pharmaceutical companies and the doctors.
It's a shit show.


The left hand paths understand the law of economy much better than the right hand paths.
The right hand paths that are visible on the planet,
the religions which are constantly seeking new adherents,
so far lost now that they're actually more damaging than they are good,
are all left hand paths now.
The left hand path answer questions.
When you meet somebody who has traveled the left hand path they know what they know and there is no faith involved.
What they are blind to are the spiritual consequences upon themselves to the left hand path.
This is what their controllers keep from them.
Every religion in the spiritual path on this planet is a form of economy,
and all economies are quid pro quo,
and all economies once established do not want to go away.
Just try telling allopathic medicine that they have to give up the pharmaceutical and medical revenue from schizophrenia and see what happens.
Very often everything that happens in these other worlds is visible on this physical plane.
In fact the invisible worlds must represent themselves in this physical reality because there's a law of descent which states that that which exists above must manifest below.
It's a system of what we might call astral encryption.
Once you have the cipher you can decipher the astral to physical overlay.
The cipher is a state of consciousness,
not a data sequence or key.
The key characteristic of the of consciousness is an almost animal-like sensitivity to energy patterns outside the five senses.
It's achieved by near death experiences,
spiritual practice,
and trauma.
I say animal-like because it presents itself instinctively,
the way a dog smells or a rabbit hears.
You're never looking for it.
There's no mental activity.
It simply presents itself.
You know over time the lay of the land in this tangential energetic space.
You become a traveler.
Everywhere things travel they trade.
The law of exchanges dictates it.
Are you getting the picture?


The whole layered reality is a system of exchange,
not too dissimilar from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Everything in nature,
and the supernatural is natural to the inner person,
because that's the only reality it knows,
exchanges,
and where things exchange they organize,
whether it be an anthill or the solar system,
and they organize around the economy,
the exchange.
It's an endless series of exchanges no different than the ecosystem you see in a pond.
This is what has been so perverted in the human mind.
There is this idea of an absolute battle between good and evil.
No such battle exists.
In this regard I place the blame squarely on the mismanagement of the Abrahamic teachings.
To live life without an adversary is to risk not growing at all.
Adversity is your best friend in life.
Never go looking for adversity but where it finds you meet it squarely with your feet planted in the ground.
It's there to make you a new being.
Human transformation is an endless series of conflicts.
It's as though the entire natural world which exists on predation is replicated inside each and every one of us.
Instead of larger creatures in nature looking to consume us.
the beings and entities on the other side who require the energy we produce to survive prey upon us.


In every phase of life we cultivate energy.
How we spend our own energy determines the outcome of our life.
It's always best to find something to make offerings to.
It's really the only way to expand your consciousness.
You have to enter into a spiritual economy.
When you offer your best energy to the creator you're investing in the creator.
Your best energy is offered up and deep gratitude and complete submission.
The dividends are astounding.
Everything is an economy.
This is the greatest secret you're not told.
It hinted at in the countless other forms of divination both modern and primitive.
But in the end it just is what it is.
When you stop trying to hack it all the time and extorted for some personal benefit to your lower chakras then you enter the larger economy,
then you become a shareholder in creation,
and the way that Corporation is run every shareholder no matter how small this invited to the shareholder meetings.
The meetings are better than the dividend.



There's a spiritual energy in human blood.
It exists to a lesser degree in some of the animals around us.
It has to do with this environment and the richness of it.
The adrenochrome is a secondary economy for the human familiars,
the biological dividend that their otherworldly compatriots introduced to them.
It's all just an economy.
Feeding these spirits these energy allows us to do very bad stuff without being consumed by them on the other side.
So it's essentially a proxy killing.
They take the negative energy that we put into the animal and consume it.
