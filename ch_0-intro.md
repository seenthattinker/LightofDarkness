Introduction
====================



It was shortly after finishing Stardust Ranch:
The Incredible True Story that I saw a Robert Wiegand interviewed on a YouTube channel.
I knew immediately that this was the follow-up book to Stardust Ranch.
I had as many questions asked as answered in writing Stardust Ranch.
I knew that another book was the way to answer my questions,
and,
in answering my questions,
I could simultaneously do the same for anyone else who had similar questions as a result of reading Stardust Ranch.


It's one thing to answer your own questions in life.
It's entirely another thing to answer questions for other people.
The sharing process is an integral part of life.
It allows us to be of service to others,
and there is no greater calling in life than to be of service to others.
Bob agreed to do a book with me within five minutes of speaking with me on Skype.
He didn't know who I was.
He had not read Stardust Ranch.
He just decided then and there to give me the opportunity to tell his story,
which I intuitively knew was much deeper and richer than any YouTube interview could capture.


The human race remembers only a few kinds of stories over long periods of time.
We remember the stories of the spiritual teachers,
and we remember the stories of the warriors.
Everybody knows who Abraham and Arjuna are,
just as everyone knows who Achilles and Alexander the Great are.
Nobody is more recorded in the human memory than the warrior and the holy man.
They are the same person in two different missions.
Both have the task of speaking the truth.
Both are willing to give up their lives for what they are committed to doing,
and both live a reckless self-denial for the greater good.


This story,
The Light Of Darkness,
is indeed a warrior's tale for our time.
Bob is a highly trained warrior,
having gone through Navy Special Warfare in the late eighties.
His life has been an unfolding of his consciousness,
and he has arrived at a point where he has a message for the whole human race.
The warrior's path has always been akin to the path of the seeker.
It has something to do with the proximity of death in one's life when they take up the warrior's position,
the sword and shield.
It's impossible to consider your own death by violence without also considering the deeper meaning of life.



As I wrote this book I was reminded of many people I have gotten to know in my own life of study and unfoldment.
The one that kept coming back to mind most often was Milarepa.
He was born sometime around 1030 AD  and died somewhere around 1120 AD.
He remains one of the most prominent figures in the history of Tibetan Buddhism,
and he is a constant reminder that the path of redemption is open to all people no matter how dark they go in their life journey.


He was born in Western Tibet,
and his family was quite prosperous,
but his father died when he was a young boy,
and his immediate family was robbed of their wealth by aunts and uncles and other extended family.
His mother was furious.
Being an obedient son,
he did as he was told and went to study black magic at his mother's request.
His mission was to master the dark arts and take revenge on those who had robbed his family of their land and position.
All of this was at his mother's request.
The story has it that he perfected the dark arts at a very young age and returned to his mother and was able to murder some forty members of his family while they were attending a wedding by creating a hail storm.


Upon the completion of the task his mother had set him upon,
he felt tremendous remorse.
Here the lesson is,
no matter what authority orders you to do an evil act,
the effect upon the heart by the action
&mdash;
the consequence of the action
&mdash;
is upon the doer,
not the person who orders the deed to be done.


It was Milarepa who had to live with the dark act of murdering forty people.
It was almost more than he could bear.
Having fulfilled his obligation to his mother,
he left home and sought initiation into the mysteries of spiritual enlightenment.
He found a teacher in Marpa,
who saw a streak of obstinance in the young man and set him to numerous tasks that were arduous and bone-breaking,
like building a stone house,
which Marpa had Milarepa redo nineteen times to break his stubborn streak,
which had developed as a result of the power generated by the magical practice.
Finally,
Milarepa was given the teachings,
and sent on his way to go and do his practice.



It was not easy for a man who had committed the heinous acts that Milarepa had committed to find any kind of peace in the meditative practice.
He was visited and assailed by many demonic forces,
all of which he overcame,
and some of which he actually converted to the path of enlightenment.
He achieved his goal.
So great was his power that it is said he could fly.
He left many of his teachings with the people who he ministered to through a book called the One Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa.
In the springtime he would go down to the villages and speak with the people in the form of songs that he spontaneously composed,
and they were recorded by the villagers and became part of his principle text.


In the end the warrior's path is an internal one because most of our conflict is generated first internally and then manifested in the world.
This is true for us as individuals and collectivities like nations.
Our final battle is with ourselves,
just as Milarepa took up the task of himself and transcended his ego and self construct to become a beautiful example of the light and wisdom that is present in creation.


>Ye ghosts and demons, enemies of the Dharma,\
I welcome you today!\
It is my pleasure to receive you!\
I pray you, stay; do not hasten to leave;\
We will discourse and play together.\
Although you would be gone, stay the night;\
We will pit the Black against the White Dharma,\
And see who plays the best. 

Like Pheidippides himself,
Robert Wiegand has run from Marathon to Athens to give us news from the battlefield.
It was my honor and privilege to be a part of this story.
