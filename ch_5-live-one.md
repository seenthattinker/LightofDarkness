A Live One
=======================



The rafts we used in the training were all beat up.
I think they were from Vietnam.
We had to constantly repair them,
patch holes,
paint them,
and any other thing that came up.
At every phase of training there is a helmet and a T-shirt color.
We were given fiberglass helmets at the beginning of training and we first painted them green.
We wear the green helmet with a white T-shirt.
After the initial warm up month,
hell week came.

Hell week is exactly what it sounds like.
The chief characteristic is that you're not allowed to sleep for five and a half days.
When you make it through hell week you get a green T-shirt.
The entire training is extremely hierarchical.
When you start with a white T-shirt,
the green T-shirts will not talk to you.
They don't want to know you.
There's no guarantee you're going to make it through hell week.
The harassment was nonstop as well.
The helmets had to be kept in tip-top shape.
Instructors would come by in the evening and take a helmet off your bunk and smash it on the ground and tarnish the paint job.
They would say,
I want that looking like it was before I smashed it in the morning.
They did stuff like that all the time.
I learned early on that the key to a more peaceful progression through the training was to go unnoticed.
Stay in the middle of the pack.
Don't be at the front and don't be at the back.
Blend into the middle.


Hell week is exactly what you think it might be with five and a half days of no sleep and constant physical training accompanied by sporadic interruptions of meals and downtime with flash bombs and weapons firing around you.
The combination of being physically worn down by the training,
the swimming in the ocean,
and the terror tactics take you to a state of mind that is completely surreal.
A lot of us hallucinated.
I remember seeing triangle shaped UFOs in the sky when I was out on the raft and talking in my head with aliens on the craft.
Some in my class told me they spoke with dead relatives.
Hell week literally takes you out of your mind.
I'm not using that as a euphemism for crazy.
I mean the sleep deprivation,
weariness of muscles and tendons and joints,
and the shock and awe theatrics of the trainers takes you to a place inside yourself that I might equate only to the state of mind a nomadic tribe might experience during a difficult seasonal migration.
The whole point of the training is to take you to a place you've never been.
It's part of the breaking down process.
The military is all about breaking you down.
The special forces are the military on steroids.
Everyone around you is going through the same thing.
So there really isn't anybody to tell you that you're going crazy.
The instructors add to the chaos rather than take away from it.
They're not there to be our friends.
They're there to break whoever does not belong in Navy Special Warfare.
So we all kind of gradually slipped into this *out of our minds* state together.
It seemed normal to us.




We had a meal every six hours during hell week.
That's four meals a day.
That was also our break and we got one hour.
As hell week progressed the instructors started fucking with us in the mess hall.
We had to stand up and do little plays and sometimes lean against each other.
Hell week is not allowed to be observed by any outsiders.
There's a reason that hell week is such a secret.
You can't even really grasp what's going on unless you see it.
I'm one of the few people who has ever observed hell week as a non participant.
I designed a knife for the Navy Special Warfare teams and it was accepted as standard issue.
The design was given to Gerber and they produce the knife.
It's called the Silver Trident.
In actuality I just designed the handle,
but my point in telling this story is that in delivering the knives I had the chance to see candidates in hell week.
It's sheer lunacy.
They're not even there.
I wasn't even there when I went through it.
It's like they're riding on autopilot.
There's a reason that one of the expressions for madness is being beside yourself.
When you go outside of your mind you often have this perspective where you're literally beside yourself and looking at yourself.
You're operating.
You could be walking and talking,
but you're not there.
There's a subjectivity to the personal experience of it that is not fully contextualized until you observe it from a normal state of mind,
which is,
I suppose,
why no outsiders are allowed to see hell week.



The way you get through hell week is to compartmentalize yourself deep inside your brain.
By the time you're done the training you have several compartments inside yourself you've created by the various phases of the training.
I suppose you could say it's a form of trauma-based mind control or mind expansion to teach survival skills at the deeper levels of consciousness.
I can tell you that if what was done to us was done to an animal the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) would be all over the abusers,
but human beings have consciousness and therefore we're able to consent,
and where we consent there is no abuse.
That's a very important thing to understand,
not just for surviving Navy Special Warfare training but for many aspects of life.


The one thing that you become thoroughly acquainted with throughout hell week is the raft.
That raft is with you everywhere you go.
You have to maintain it.
You have to run with it over your head in a team.
Before you can have any one of your meals during hell week
&mdash;
breakfast,
lunch,
dinner,
and the midnight meal
&mdash;
you have to hold it over your head for fifteen minutes.
After that everybody goes inside to eat except for one man who has to stay outside with a paddle and watch the raft.
That man is replaced by another designated man once he's done eating.
I did it a few times.
While you're watching the raft,
trainers walk up and try to talk to you and fuck with you because we're not allowed to talk.
If you get caught talking hell week takes on an even more aggressive dimension.
You get singled out.

We also sing everywhere we go for hell week.
We're forced to sing,
but really it's one of the best things during hell week.
When you sing your heart stays light and you don't really feel any sorrow.
A sense of humor is also always present.
Laughter has a way of reconstituting you.
The Latin American poet,
Pablo Neruda,
said that laughter is the language of the soul.
I can tell you that if you're going to make it through hell week and Special Warfare Training in the navy you have to be able to laugh.
Laughter has a way of taking tragedy and flipping it on its head.
Ever since I went through Navy Special Warfare training I have to be a little bit cautious about when I laugh.
Some people think I'm laughing at them.
I'm not.
But I can laugh in the most tragic of circumstances because the laughter transforms the tragedy.
It puts the negative circumstance in its proper place and allows a being to persist.
Otherwise sorrow will drown you very quickly.

It was one hundred and ten degrees Fahrenheit during my hell week,
and they typically made us run everywhere with the rafts.
Because it was a hundred and ten degrees during the day,
they didn't let us run due to heat exhaustion,
and there were guys dropping due to heat exhaustion.
So what they did to replace running was they took us on an eight hour tour of the base with the rafts held up over our heads.
They took us to every office and command center.
It turned out to be a giant pain in the ass.
Most of us would have preferred the run because it was only four miles and if you didn't faint due to heat exhaustion you were done.
But to walk around the base for eight hours,
holding that raft over our heads,
was unbearably brutal on the arms, 
back, 
shoulders,
and the whole body.
That's the way these instructors worked.
If they were told they couldn't do something like run due to heat exhaustion they would replace it with something that would make you wish you ran.
They did that with everything.
If any plan deviated,
the alternative was an escalated form of the original intent of the training or exercise.
Just for your information,
the raft was approximately two-hundred and twenty pounds,
and it was held aloft by six people.
That's not an extraordinary amount of weight distributed over six strong young men,
but over time it feels like you've got the world on your shoulders.
I felt like I lost an inch in height after a day of carrying the raft.
Then,
to be the especially brutal bastards they could be,
the instructors designed the idea of spraying us with water,
and,
while doing so,
incidentally filling up the rafts above our heads with water adding who knows how many more pounds to the lift.


Another popular thing for the instructors to do during hell week was to throw us in the water at night.
It was really cold,
around forty degrees Fahrenheit.
We weren't allowed to wear wet suits.
We went into the water in our long green pants,
our combat boots,
and a long-sleeve combat shirt with a collar and buttons.
What we had to do then was strip down to nothing in the water and turn our pants into a flotation device.
I won't bore you with the details of how that's done,
but I will tell you that one of the steps in the process was to take our boots off and tie them around our necks.
As luck and circumstance would have it,
someone dropped his boots to the floor of the bay.
The instructors refused to allow us to leave the water until the boots were retrieved.
We were there for quite some time.
It went on too long for the instructors,
so to lend incentive they said whoever finds the boots their boat crew can sit out the rest of the night's training.
I swam over to that guy and I said,
Dude,
tell me exactly where you were when you lost those boots.
Now you have to remember,
I'd been scuba diving for twenty-one years by this point,
so I had him mark his position by the seawall,
the exact spot he was.
My father introduced me to scuba diving.
I started in a pool at his apartment complex.
I was seven years old. 
After that I dove any time I could.
I took courses when I was a teenager,
and I already had all my civilian dive certifications before Navy Special Warfare.
Once he was sure,
I dove down with my eyes open.
I started visualizing the boots.
And this is when I started realizing I had a high level of intuition.
I'd already seen all the paranormal stuff in the Mormon mission,
but the realization of my heightened intuition had not come to me yet at twenty-eight years of age.
I saw inside my head where to go,
and I was led to the bottom.
My hand landed on his boot and I picked them both up.
My boat crew sat out the rest of the night's training,
and we got to put our clothes on.
The rest of them had to lay on a steel platform,
butt ass naked,
getting hosed with water.


I can't begin to describe the physical pain of hell week as it accumulates day after day.
I sustained injuries in my feet that persisted for the rest of my training after hell week.
I also had what might have been my most spiritual experience during hell week.
In one of the exercises when we were running on asphalt,
the instructors would grab the bow line of the boat and pull it faster and faster until you were sprinting.
You didn't want to lose the boat.
Losing the boat would bring consequences.
By this time at the midpoint of hell week we knew what consequences were and you just didn't want consequences.


In this particular exercise the instructors pull the bow line as hard and fast as they can and other instructors are kicking and screaming and taking punches at us and we're sprinting on asphalt with this two-hundred and twenty pound raft over our heads.
It's absolutely insane.
The instructors would sling smaller instructors right up into the raft while it was over our head and we were sprinting,
so then you would be sprinting with the weight of the raft and the added weight of the instructor,
which was never less than a hundred and fifty pounds.


The whole time you're doing this,
you're sprinting on pavement in combat boots that have a steel shank,
and after some time your feet start to feel as though somebody is taking a sledgehammer and slamming it into them.
Everybody is in acute pain,
but nobody wants to stop because the consequences are too great.
All you hear are these grunts and these screams,
*go,
go*.
Then,
all of a sudden I could only hear one thing.
It was the voice of somebody completely broken,
and they were saying,
*mommy,
mommy*,
over and over.
It took a moment or two,
but I realized it was my voice.
I had been broken to the point of a kid a little older than a toddler.
My vision started pulsating red.
The red got darker and darker,
like looking at lava without any peripheral vision,
then I saw a pinpoint of white light in the red,
and it grew and grew and got brighter,
right in the middle of this deep magenta red that had colored my whole vision,
then I had a white out.
They called it a white out.
We all had it.
The exercise was designed to produce it through the pain and intensity.
A white out is when you temporarily leave your body even while your body is still functioning.
It develops a heightened sense of intuition and clairvoyance.
They literally forced me out of my body in the training.
I could see everything inside my head so clearly.
It was like I was being reborn.
I was a new person.


I'll take a moment here to explain that this is a lot of what the trauma-based augmentation programs like MK Ultra were all about.
What they are doing in a lot of these programs is continually drowning people and bringing them back until their spirit leaves their body.
They're trying to do exactly what was done in the Navy Special Warfare training.
It's very important that you go through this world with a minimal amount of judgment.
The only real judgment we can apply at the end of the day is natural law, 
which includes the supernatural, 
and excludes the preternatural.
The compartmentalization that they want to create in the training is to keep you going under any circumstance. 
Lose a leg from the knee down? 
Keep going. 
Bullet through the hand? 
Keep going.
Hell week teaches you to keep going.



The instructors know what's going on when we white out.
They can see it in our eyes.
When one of us goes into this super consciousness they say out loud,
*We've got a live one here*.
It's kind of beautiful when you think about it.
Through the horror of the training,
the unrelenting discipline and endurance,
there is this profound spiritual experience.

I broke the metatarsal bones in both my feet running on the asphalt.
I went to see the doctor for the pain.
He confirmed the fractured bones.
I was given a choice of stopping and rejoining the training where I stopped at a future class or continuing.
I finished my training with two broken feet.
